40079237	Insect metamorphosis and chitin metabolism under miRNA regulation: a review with current advances.	Insect metamorphosis is a complex developmental process regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) and hormonal signaling pathways. Key genes driving insect ontogenic changes are precisely modulated by miRNAs, which interact with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) to coordinate developmental transitions. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding miRNA biogenesis, their regulatory roles in gene expression, and their involvement in critical biological processes, including metamorphosis and chitin metabolism. miRNAs are now recognized as essential regulators of chitin metabolism and hormonal signaling, ensuring precise control of insect development. Disrupting the expression of participating genes in hormone signaling pathways through miRNAs leads to aberrant metamorphosis and consequent lethal outcomes, highlighting their potential as targets for pest control. This review summarizes current advances in miRNA-mediated regulation of insect metamorphosis and chitin metabolism, with a focus on their interactions with 20E and JH signaling pathways. By integrating recent findings, we provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA function in developmental transitions and their potential applications in insect pest management strategies. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.
40079208	Influence of organic mulches and soil properties on the phenolic profile of leaves, canes and grape skins in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.).	Applying organic amendments to vineyard soil improves soil properties and vine development by increasing soil water retention and nutrient content. However, little is known about how organic mulches modify grapevine phenolic composition. This study analysed the phenolic profile in the leaves, canes, and grape skins of Tempranillo over 3 years in two vineyard locations with three organic mulches: spent mushroom compost (SMC), grapevine pruning debris (GPD) and straw (STR), as well as two conventional soil practices: herbicide (HERB) and tillage (TILL).
40079187	Chemometric-assisted electrochemical sensor for simultaneous determination of neonicotinoids imidacloprid and thiamethoxam in honey samples.	Neonicotinoids are systemic insecticides used in agriculture. In particular, imidacloprid (IM) and thiamethoxam (TM) have selective toxicity to insects, and they have been implicated in the steep decline of the global honeybee population, specifically in colony collapse disorder (CCD). Some scientific reports have shown that a significant amount of honey worldwide contains traces of neonicotinoids, at levels strong enough to cause damage to bees. Therefore, the development of portable and low-cost sensor devices to permit rapid detection of these neonicotinoids in the field (<i>in situ</i>) is of great importance. The main goal of this work was the development of an electrochemical method, for the first time, to simultaneously determine IM and TM, which can occur in honey samples from Argentina. The electrochemical sensor was based on a pretreated glassy carbon electrode (GCE) using square wave voltammetry (SWV) as the analytical technique. All parameters involved in the response were optimized using a central composite design. The SWV response was modeled using the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. Recovery experiments were performed with spiked honey samples, yielding recovery values from 90% to 107% without pretreatment of the samples. The proposed method is presented as a very good and simple alternative for determining IM and TM in Argentina honeys samples.
40078837	Electric Heating Pad as an Adjuvant Treatment of Extensive Chromoblastomycosis in Immunocompetent Patient: A Case Report.	Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, caused by melanized fungi. In cases with extensive cutaneous lesions, heat therapy can be used as an adjuvant to systemic antifungal therapy. This case report aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of heat therapy using an electric heating pad as an adjuvant to itraconazole in the treatment of extensive chromoblastomycosis. A 60-year-old immunocompetent male presented with ten-year history of extensive verrucous erythematous plaques with atrophic central lesions located in the right arm. Histology and mycological examination from a direct smear and skin biopsy revealed muriform cells and pathognomonic chromoblastomycosis. Cultures grew dark-pigmented colonies, yielding <i>Fonsecaea spp</i>. A combination therapy of itraconazole 400 mg daily and topical heat therapy using an electric heating pad resulted in clinical improvement during the first month of treatment. Heat therapy can be administered as an adjuvant to systemic antifungal therapy because of its fungistatic and fungicidal effects, and its ability to enhance the patient's immune response. The selection of a suitable heat therapy device is crucial for improving the success of therapy. In this case, the patient demonstrated significant improvement in cutaneous lesions after one month of combination therapy with itraconazole and heat therapy. Electric heating pads are a good choice for topical heat therapy because of their stable temperature, availability, affordability, and ease of use. Heat therapy using electric heating pads is an effective adjuvant to systemic antifungal therapy in the treatment of extensive chromoblastomycosis.

40078089	Asymmetric Synthesis of S(IV)-Stereogenic Sulfinimidate Esters by Sulfinamide Activation.	Catalyst-controlled approaches for the synthesis of S-stereogenic compounds have propelled significant advancements in asymmetric synthetic chemistry. In contrast, control over S-heteroatom (e.g. O) bond formation to access sulfinimidate esters remains an underexplored area. Drawing inspiration from recent progress in electrophilic amide activation, herein, we present a sulfinamide activation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of S-chiral sulfinimidate esters. This method involves the activation of racemic sulfinamides by sulfonyl chloride, yielding a reactive aza-sulfinyl mixed anhydride intermediate. Employing a naturally occurring cinchonidine catalyst, the process achieves excellent enantiocontrol in the subsequent formation of S-O bonds with alcohols involving a dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) process, resulting in sulfinimidate esters with excellent enantioselectivity. The catalytically obtained enantioenriched sulfinimidate esters offer a versatile platform for the construction of S-stereogenic frameworks, including sulfilimines and sulfoximines, with promising applications in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery.
40077607	Simultaneous Determination of Six Acidic Pesticides, Including 2,4-DB and 2,4,5-T with No Established MRL in Korea Using LC-MS/MS and QuEChERS for the Safety of Imported Agricultural Products.	The use of pesticides is essential for the production of high-quality agricultural products. However, the repeated application of pesticides has led to the contamination of environments, such as the atmosphere, soil, and surface water, affecting ecosystems and leading to residues on crops, which pose potential risks to human health. Accordingly, regulations regarding pesticide usage, application frequency, timing, and maximum residue limits have been established to manage residual pesticides. The Positive List System (PLS), with a default tolerance of 0.01 ppm, has been applied to both domestic and imported agricultural products for which no established maximum residue limits (MRLs) exist in Korea. This study developed a multi-residue analytical method for the simultaneous determination of six pesticides, including 2,4-DB and 2,4,5-T, for which no domestic MRLs have been established, as well as for 2,4-D, 4-CPA, Dicamba, and Dichlorprop, for the management of imported agricultural products. The target pesticides were extracted and purified using the QuEChERS method and quantified by LC-MS/MS. The analytical method was validated according to the CODEX (CAC/GL 40-1993) and the Guidelines of Standard Procedures of Test Methods for Foods and Other Substances established by the MFDS. Using the developed and validated analytical method, monitoring of imported agricultural products was conducted.
40077471	A Broad-Spectrum Monoclonal Antibody-Based Heterologous ic-ELISA for the Detection of Multiple Pyrethroids in Water, Milk, Celery, and Leek.	Pyrethroids are one of the most commonly used insecticides worldwide in agriculture, public health, and household products. To monitor the presence of pyrethroids in the environment and in food, a broad-spectrum monoclonal antibody (mAb), CL/CN-1D2, was prepared. This mAb demonstrates a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for different pyrethroids: cypermethrin (129.1 µg/L), β-cypermethrin (199.6 µg/L), cyfluthrin (215.5 µg/L), fenpropathrin (220.3 µg/L), λ-cyhalothrin (226.9 µg/L), β-cyfluthrin (241.7 µg/L), deltamethrin (591.2 µg/L), and fenvalerate (763.1 µg/L). Using the mAb CL/CN-1D2, a highly sensitive heterologous indirect competitive ELISA (ic-ELISA) was developed for the rapid detection of these pyrethroids. The limit of detection (LOD) for the eight pyrethroids in water, milk, celery, and leek matrices ranged from 24.4 to 152.2 μg/kg. The recoveries ranged from 65.1% to 112.4%, with a coefficient of variation (CV) below 15%. A robust correlation (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.9945) between the ic-ELISA and GC indicated that the ic-ELISA is a reliable tool for the rapid and cost-effective screening of pyrethroids residues.
40077447	Recent Advances in Biosensor Technologies for Meat Production Chain.	Biosensors are innovative and cost-effective analytical devices that integrate biological recognition elements (bioreceptors) with transducers to detect specific substances (biomolecules), providing a high sensitivity and specificity for the rapid and accurate point-of-care (POC) quantitative detection of selected biomolecules. In the meat production chain, their application has gained attention due to the increasing demand for enhanced food safety, quality assurance, food fraud detection, and regulatory compliance. Biosensors can detect foodborne pathogens (<i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Campylobacter</i>, Shiga-toxin-producing <i>E. coli</i>/STEC, <i>L. monocytogenes</i>, etc.), spoilage bacteria and indicators, contaminants (pesticides, dioxins, and mycotoxins), antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes, hormones (growth promoters and stress hormones), and metabolites (acute-phase proteins as inflammation markers) at different modules along the meat chain, from livestock farming to packaging in the farm-to-fork (F2F) continuum. By providing real-time data from the meat chain, biosensors enable early interventions, reducing the health risks (foodborne outbreaks) associated with contaminated meat/meat products or sub-standard meat products. Recent advancements in micro- and nanotechnology, microfluidics, and wireless communication have further enhanced the sensitivity, specificity, portability, and automation of biosensors, making them suitable for on-site field applications. The integration of biosensors with blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) systems allows for acquired data integration and management, while their integration with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) enables rapid data processing, analytics, and input for risk assessment by competent authorities. This promotes transparency and traceability within the meat chain, fostering consumer trust and industry accountability. Despite biosensors' promising potential, challenges such as scalability, reliability associated with the complexity of meat matrices, and regulatory approval are still the main challenges. This review provides a broad overview of the most relevant aspects of current state-of-the-art biosensors' development, challenges, and opportunities for prospective applications and their regular use in meat safety and quality monitoring, clarifying further perspectives.
40077423	Multiclass Determination of 87 Mixed Veterinary Drugs, Pesticides and Mycotoxin Residues in Beef Muscle Samples by Ionic Liquid-Based Dispersive Liquid-Liquid Microextraction and Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry.	A miniaturised, eco-friendly and efficient multiclass method for the simultaneous determination of 87 veterinary drugs, pesticides and mycotoxin residues in beef muscle samples by ionic liquid-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (IL-DLLME) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated according to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/808 and ISO/IEC 17025: 2017. Under IL-DLLME optimum conditions, matrix calibration yielded a coefficient of determination (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) ranging from 0.99942 to 0.99997. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.93 to 23.78 µg kg<sup>-1</sup> and from 1.98 to 38.27 µg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Recoveries ranged from 80.0 to 109.8% and the decision limit (CCα) values ranged from 13.0 to 523.0 µg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Repeatability and reproducibility values were achieved in the ranges of 1.55-12.91% and 1.44-13.35%, respectively. The validated method was applied to 50 real beef samples and 12% of the tested samples contained traces of some residues, but they were all below their respective LOQs and CCα; hence, the beef was fit for human consumption. The greenness of the method was assessed using five green analytical chemistry (GAC) metrics, namely, the Analytical Eco-Scale (AES), NEMI, GAPI, AGREE and ComplexGAPI, and found to be green according to the AES metric and Analytical GREEnness Metric Approach and Software (AGREE). The method provided better results at a greatly reduced cost and analysis time in comparison with standard method.
40076830	Euphraticanoids N-T: Aromadendrane-Type Diterpenes and Sesquiterpenes with Fungicidal Activities from <i>Populus euphratica</i> Resins.	Seven previously undescribed terpenoids, including five prenylaromadendrane-type diterpenes euphraticanoids N-R (<b>1</b>-<b>5</b>) and two aromadendrane-type sesquiterpenes, euphraticanoids S and T (<b>6</b> and <b>7</b>), were isolated from <i>Populus euphratica</i> resins. Their structures, including their absolute configurations, were elucidated by HRESIMS and spectroscopic analysis, ECD calculations, and crystallographic methods. In addition, an evaluation of the fungicidal activities of compound <b>1</b> was carried out, resulting in the discovery of <b>1</b> as a fungicidal candidate lead compound with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 15.7 and 68.6 mg/L against <i>Curvularia mebaldsii</i> and <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, respectively.
40076801	A Leg Cuticle Protein Enhances the Resistance of <i>Anopheles sinensis</i> Mosquitoes to Deltamethrin.	Insecticide resistance in mosquitoes has become a severe impediment to global vector control and manifests as decreased insecticide effectiveness. The role of target site mutations and detoxification enzymes as resistance markers has been documented in mosquitoes; however, the emergence of complex resistant phenotypes suggest the occurrence of additional mechanisms. Cuticular proteins (CPs) are key constituents of the insect cuticle, and play critical roles in insect development and insecticide resistance. In this study, via electron microscopy we observed that the leg cuticle thickness in deltamethrin-resistant (DR) <i>Anopheles sinensis</i> mosquitoes was significantly greater than that measured in deltamethrin-susceptible (DS) <i>An. sinensis</i>. Transcription analysis revealed that cuticle proteins were enriched in the legs, including members of the CPR, CPAP, and CPF families. Further comparisons revealed the specific overexpression of four CP genes in the legs of DR <i>An. sinensis</i>; whose expression levels increased after treatment with deltamethrin. The RNAi-mediated silencing of one CP gene, <i>AsCPF1</i>, resulted in a significant decrease in the leg cuticle thickness of DR mosquitoes and significantly elevated the mortality rate when exposed to deltamethrin. These findings suggest that alterations in the <i>An. sinensis</i> leg cuticle contribute to the insecticide resistance phenotype. <i>AsCPF1</i> is thereby a target study molecule for investigation of its mode of action, and broader attention should be paid to the role of mosquito legs in the development of insecticide resistance.
40076704	Rotenone Induces Parkinsonism with Constipation Symptoms in Mice by Disrupting the Gut Microecosystem, Inhibiting the PI3K-AKT Signaling Pathway and Gastrointestinal Motility.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Constipation is a prodromal symptom of PD. It is important to investigate the pathogenesis of constipation symptoms in PD. Rotenone has been successfully used to establish PD animal models. However, the specific mechanism of rotenone-induced constipation symptoms is not well understood. In this work, we found that constipation symptoms appeared earlier than motor impairment in mice gavaged with a low dose of rotenone (30 mg/kg·BW). Rotenone not only caused loss of dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of α-synuclein, but also significantly reduced serum 5-HT levels and <i>5-HTR4</i> in the striatum and colon. The mRNA expression of aquaporins, gastrointestinal motility factors (<i>c-Kit</i>, <i>Cx43</i>, <i>smMLCK</i> and <i>MLC-3</i>) in mouse colon was also significantly regulated by rotenone. In addition, both colon and brain showed rotenone-induced inflammation and barrier dysfunction; the PI3K/AKT pathway in the substantia nigra and colon was also significantly inhibited by rotenone. Importantly, the structure, composition and function of the gut microbiota were also significantly altered by rotenone. Some specific taxa were closely associated with motor and constipation symptoms, inflammation, and gut and brain barrier status in PD mice. <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae_UCG</i>-<i>006</i> may play a role in exacerbating constipation symptoms, whereas <i>Acinetobacter</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Solibacillus</i> and <i>Eubacterium_xylanophilum</i>_groups may be beneficial in stimulating gastrointestinal peristalsis, maintaining motor function and alleviating inflammation and barrier damage in mice. In conclusion, low-dose rotenone can cause parkinsonism with constipation symptoms in mice by disrupting the intestinal microecosystem and inhibiting the PI3K-AKT pathway and gastrointestinal motility.
40076644	Theoretical Study on the Metabolic Mechanism of Heptachlor in Human Cytochrome P450 Enzymes.	Heptachlor (HEP) is an insecticide metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the human liver, resulting in the formation of heptachlor epoxide (HEPX). HEPX can persist in the human body for a long duration. Therefore, it can be extremely harmful. A comprehensive understanding of HEP's metabolic fate may provide a theoretical basis for mitigating associated hazards. However, the specific human CYP isoforms that metabolize HEP, and their metabolic mechanisms, remain unclear. In this study, eight human CYP isoforms were used as catalytic enzymes to investigate the metabolic mechanism of HEP using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. These results indicate that HEP primarily binds to CYP enzymes through hydrophobic interactions, and that the binding positions of HEP are determined by the composition and shape of the hydrophobic pockets near the active site. Based on the reaction distance, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 were the only three enzymes that could metabolize HEP. The epoxidation of HEP catalyzed by the doublet state of compound I was effectively concerted, and the rate-determining step was the electrophilic attack of the oxygen atom on HEP. The energy barriers of the rate-determining step vary significantly among different enzymes. A comparison of these energy barriers suggested that CYP3A5 is the most likely enzyme for HEP catalysis in humans.
40076481	Application of Biomimetic Chromatography and QSRR Approach for Characterizing Organophosphate Pesticides.	Biomimetic chromatography is a powerful tool used in the pharmaceutical industry to characterize the physicochemical properties of molecules during early drug discovery. Some studies have indicated that biomimetic chromatography may also be useful for the evaluation of toxicologically relevant molecules. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of the biomimetic chromatography approach for determining the lipophilicity, affinity to phospholipids, and bind to plasma proteins of selected organophosphate pesticides. Quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) models were proposed to understand the structural features that influence the experimentally determined properties. ACD/labs, Chemicalize, and alvaDesc software were used to calculate theoretical descriptors. Multilinear regression was used as the regression type, and feature selection was supported by a genetic algorithm. The obtained QSRR models were validated internally and externally, and they demonstrated satisfactory performance with key statistical parameters ranged from 0.844 to 0.914 for R<sup>2</sup> and 0.696-0.898 for R<sup>2</sup><sub>ext</sub>, respectively, indicating good predictive ability.
40076478	Omics Approaches in Understanding Insecticide Resistance in Mosquito Vectors.	In recent years, the emergence of insecticide resistance has been a major challenge to global public health. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon in mosquito vectors is paramount for the formulation of effective vector control strategies. This review explores the current knowledge of insecticide resistance mechanisms through omics approaches. Genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomics approaches have proven crucial to understand these resilient vectors. Genomic studies have identified multiple genes associated with insecticide resistance, while transcriptomics has revealed dynamic gene expression patterns in response to insecticide exposure and other environmental stimuli. Proteomics and metabolomics offer insights into protein expression and metabolic pathways involved in detoxification and resistance. Integrating omics data holds immense potential to expand our knowledge on the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes via information obtained from different omics platforms to understand regulatory mechanisms and differential expression of genes and protein, and to identify the transcription factors and novel molecules involved in the detoxification of insecticides. Eventually, these data will help construct predictive models, identify novel strategies, and develop targeted interventions to control vector-borne diseases.

This study reports the synthesis, characterization, and antifungal evaluation of a series of pyridoxal and salicylaldehyde derivatives, using synthetic methodologies such as radical cyclizations and click chemistry. Compounds <b>6a</b> and <b>6b</b>, featuring a fused dihydrobenzoxepine-pyridine scaffold, demonstrated effective fungicidal activity with MIC values of 19 µg/mL against <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> 2807. Similarly, compound <b>6b</b> exhibited notable activity with a MIC of 75 µg/mL against <i>Candida auris</i> PUJ-HUSI 537. Both compounds outperformed fluconazole (FLC) in these strains. In silico ADMET profiling revealed favorable pharmacokinetic properties, including blood-brain barrier penetration and drug-likeness parameters consistent with Lipinski's rule of five. Cytotoxicity assays on human fibroblasts confirmed the low toxicity of compound <b>6a</b> at the tested concentrations. These results highlight the potential of the fused dihydrobenzoxepine-pyridine scaffold as a promising antifungal candidate for further investigations.
40076325	Heterocyclic Antidepressants with Antimicrobial and Fungicide Activity.	In this review, the presence of antimicrobial and fungicidal activity in heterocyclic antidepressants was investigated. The already proven connection between the intestinal microbiome and mental health prompted the idea of whether these drugs disrupt the normal intestinal microflora. In addition, there is a serious problem of increasing resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics. In this article, we found that almost all of the antidepressants considered (except moclobemide, haloperidol, and doxepin) have antimicrobial activity and can suppress the growth of not only pathogenic microorganisms but also the growth of bacteria that directly affect mental health (such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Lactococcus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Enterococcus</i>, and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>).
40076304	Synthesis, Characterization, and Evaluation of the Antifungal Properties of 3-Indolyl-3-Hydroxy Oxindole Derivatives Against Plant Pathogenic Fungi.	To discover novel fungicides with good inhibitory effects on plant fungal diseases, twenty-five 3-indolyl-3-hydroxy oxindole derivatives (3a-3y) were synthesized. These newly derivatives were characterized by NMR and HRMS. Their antifungal activities against five plant pathogenic fungi were assessed in vitro. Most of the compounds exhibited moderate to excellent antifungal activities against the five pathogenic fungi. Notably, compounds <b>3t</b>, <b>3u</b>, <b>3v</b>, and <b>3w</b> displayed remarkable and broad-spectrum antifungal activities comparable to or superior to those of the fungicides carvacrol (CA) and phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). Among them, compound <b>3u</b> displayed the most excellent antifungal activity against <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> Kühn (<i>R. solani</i>), with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 3.44 mg/L, which was superior to CA (7.38 mg/L) and PCA (11.62 mg/L). Preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) results indicated that the introduction of I, Cl, or Br substituents at position 5 of the 3-hydroxy-2-oxindole and indole rings is crucial for compounds to exhibit good antifungal activity. The in vivo antifungal activity assay showed that compound 3u has good curative effects against <i>R. solani</i>. The current results suggest that these compounds are capable of serving as promising lead compounds.
40076259	Chemical Composition and Larvicidal Activity Against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> of the Leaf Essential Oils from <i>Croton blanchetianus</i>.	The <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito is the primary vector of dengue, a neglected disease and a serious public health problem in tropical countries. The control of this vector has been carried out using chemical insecticides, which impact human health. Thus, it is essential to develop natural larvicides that are less harmful to the environment. This study investigates the circadian cycle and larvicidal activity of essential oils from <i>Croton blanchetianus</i> against <i>Aedes aegypti</i>. The leaf oils were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS and GC-FID. The circadian study revealed variations in the chemical composition of oils extracted at different times of the day. The main constituents were <i>α-pinene</i>, <i>β-phellandrene</i>, <i>eucalyptol</i>, <i>β-caryophyllene</i>, <i>bicyclogermacrene</i>, and <i>spathulenol</i>. The larvicidal activity showed LC<sub>50</sub> values at the following different collection times: 55.294 ± 3.209 μg/mL at 08:00 h; 95.485 ± 2.684 μg/mL at 12:00 h; and 64.883 ± 1.780 μg/mL at 17:00 h. Molecular docking simulations indicated that <i>α-pinene</i>, <i>β-phellandrene</i>, <i>eucalyptol</i>, and <i>β-caryophyllene</i> strongly interact with the active site of the sterol carrier protein, suggesting their role in larvicidal activity. These findings reinforce the potential of <i>C. blanchetianus</i> essential oils as an alternative for <i>Aedes aegypti</i> control. The predictive pharmacokinetic tests showed a PAMPA profile associated with high effective cellular permeability and microsomal stability, resulting from the metabolic stability of the derivatives (3) <i>eucalyptol</i> and (6) <i>spathulenol</i>, indicating that these compounds have the highest pharmacokinetic viability and low reactivity with respect to organ toxicity.

40076248	Essential Oil from <i>Curcuma Longa</i> Leaves: Using Nanotechnology to Make a Promising Eco-Friendly Bio-Based Pesticide from Medicinal Plant Waste.	Nano-emulsions of essential oils (EO) and their chemical constituents are promising raw materials for the ecological control of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>. <i>Curcuma longa</i> L. is a plant known for the properties of its rhizome, which is used in food, health, and hygiene products. Although its leaves are considered by-products with no commercial value, they produce an essential oil rich in bioactive monoterpenoids. This study aims to evaluate the repellency of nano-emulsions containing the EO from leaves of <i>C. longa</i> or its three main chemical constituents against <i>T. castaneum</i>. The representative mixture of EO extracted in four different months showed <i>p</i>-cymene (26.0%), 1,8-cineole (15.1%), and terpinolene (15.5%) as major compounds. Nano-emulsions of EO (HLB 16.7), terpinolene (HLB 15.0), 1,8-cineole (HLB15.0), and <i>p</i>-cymene (HLB 15.0) were repellent at concentrations of 11 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> (EO, terpinolene, and <i>p</i>-cymene) and 1.1 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> (1,8-cineole). The EO nano-emulsion droplet size increased linearly over time, remaining below 300 nm for 35 days. The EO nano-emulsion proved to be a green alternative to synthetic pesticides, as it was safe against the bioindicator <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>. Furthermore, its main constituents were able to inhibit in silico the enzyme telomerase of <i>T. castaneum</i>, which is an enzyme essential for life. This study provides ideas for the utilization of EO from leaves of <i>C. longa</i> as raw material for new environmentally friendly plant-derived nanobiopesticides.
40076246	Study on Design, Synthesis and Herbicidal Activity of Novel 4-Amino-6-(5-Aryl-Substituted-1-Pyrazolyl)-3-Chloro-5-Fluoro-2-Picolinic Acids.	6-Aryl-2-picolinic acid herbicides are an important subclass of auxin herbicides, characterized by their good absorption and conductivity, broad weed control spectrum, and excellent herbicidal activity against some resistant weeds. Based on previous studies from our group and the distinct characteristics of physico-chemical properties and biological activities of active skeleton structure containing fluorine atoms, this paper introduces the design and synthesis of 41 novel 4-amino-6-(5-aryl-substituted-1-pyrazolyl)-3-chloro-5-fluoro-2-picolinic acid compounds. The test of inhibiting <i>A. thaliana</i> roots growth showed that most of the <b>S</b>-series compounds exhibited superior inhibitory effects compared to picloram, with six compounds demonstrated even better inhibitory capability than the new herbicidal molecule florpyrauxifen. For example, compound <b>S202</b>, at a concentration of 0.5 µmol/L, exhibited a 78.4% inhibition of <i>A. thaliana</i> root growth, whereas florpyrauxifen showed only a 33.8% inhibition. Root growth inhibition tests on weeds showed that 28 compounds, at a concentration of 250 µM, demonstrated a greater than 80% inhibition of <i>Brassica napus</i> (BN) root growth. Post-emergence herbicidal activity tests showed that most compounds exhibited good inhibitory effects on broadleaf weeds, with 10 compounds achieving a 100% inhibition of the growth of <i>Amaranthus retroflexus L</i> (AL). These results demonstrate that some of the 4-amino-6-(5-aryl-substituted-1-pyrazolyl)-3-chloro-5-fluoro-2-picolinic acid compounds could be used as potential lead structures in the discovery of novel synthetic auxin herbicides.
40075477	Through the eyes of the participant: using photovoice to understand the experiences and effects of ivermectin MDA in the context of the BOHEMIA clinical trial in Kwale, Kenya.	Assessing the acceptability of new malaria control interventions in clinical trials can be complex due to the need for strict ethical standards and specific trial procedures. While in-depth interviews and focus group discussions can provide useful insights, a more participatory method of data collection which complements these methods is photovoice. Photovoice offers a unique approach, empowering participants to share their experiences and perceptions on their own terms. Photovoice was employed alongside the BOHEMIA clinical trial (a trial investigating the safety and efficacy of ivermectin mass-drug administration (MDA) for malaria control) to explore participants' views on the trial and the effects of the intervention on individuals and communities.

40075079	Critical review of the potential effects and risks to pollinators and aquatic organisms from the agricultural uses of sulfoxaflor; introductory comments.	The first paper in a series of seven serves as an overview of the initiation of the insecticide Sulfoxaflor Environmental Science review process and provides some regulatory background. The following papers are a series and describe a critical analysis of the data related to sulfoxaflor in terms of its uses, properties, environmental fate, and potential effects on aquatic organisms, and pollinators. The last paper describes a refined model for hazard and risk assessment of pesticides in pollinators.
40074850	Assessment of in-house reference materials for multi-pesticide residue analysis in three food matrices by LC-MS/MS: development, homogeneity, and stability.	In-house reference materials (ihRM) are an alternative to the limited supply of reference materials for method validation and assurance of the validity of pesticide residue results. Currently, limited information exists on producing ihRM of pesticide residues in food for laboratory testing purposes for the desired matrix/analyte/concentration combination. This study aimed to develop in-house reference materials for three food matrices: banana, rice, and green coffee spiked with a total of 22 pesticides, which were selected for their relevance in food matrices, with pK<sub>OW</sub> values ranging from -0.13 to 5.8 following the guidelines of ISO Guide 80:2014. In this study, we assessed the impact of spiking (solvent) and drying conditions (freeze-dried and oven) on homogeneity uncertainty. The final step of this work involved evaluating the homogeneity and kinetics for long-term stability (4 °C) according to the ISO 33405 guidelines, using a fully validated method based on QuEChERS and measurement by LC-MS/MS through a completely randomized block design with two-way ANOVA, and simple linear regression analysis for homogeneity and stability, respectively. In general, for the three matrices, it was found that using a predominantly aqueous solvent (>70%) and freeze-drying resulted in sufficient homogeneity and no significant processing trends (slope p-value > 0.05), compared to using an organic medium (>70%), which resulted in uncertainties up to 50 times higher for several analytes. On the other hand, uncertainties for long-term stability below 3% were obtained for most of the analytes at 4 °C. The results demonstrate that homogeneous and stable ihRMs can be obtained under the provided preparation conditions, although special attention is required for processing conditions, particularly for the banana at a larger scale.
40074677	Enantioselective Behaviors and Risk Assessments of Chiral Pesticide Mefentrifluconazole in Four Types of Fruits and Vegetables.	Mefentrifluconazole was the first novel isopropyl alcohol triazole fungicide. Existing research indicated that <i>R-</i>mefentrifluconazole had high activity and low toxicity, presenting potential for monocase application, while limited data existed on its enantioselective dissipation in crops. Here, after confirming the absolute configuration, the enantioselective dissipation and risk assessments of chiral mefentrifluconazole in soybeans, peanuts, tomatoes, grapes, and soil were conducted. The preferential dissipation of <i>R-</i>mefentrifluconazole was verified in soybean plants, soybeans, peanut plants, tomatoes, and grapes. The preferential dissipation of <i>S-</i>mefentrifluconazole was verified in the peanut shells and soil. The stereoisomeric excess variations of mefentrifluconazole in soybean plants, soybean, peanut plants, and peanut shells exceeded 10%, and the enantiomer toxicity and behavior differences should be considered in risk assessments. The dietary risks of acute (0.020-1.250%) and chronic (0.054-18.328%) of mefentrifluconazole in these crops were acceptable. <i>R-</i>Mefentrifluconazole might be recommended for use as a monocase product.
40074641	The links between soil and water pollution and cardiovascular disease.	Soil and water pollution represent significant threats to global health, ecosystems, and biodiversity. Healthy soils underpin terrestrial ecosystems, supporting food production, biodiversity, water retention, and carbon sequestration. However, soil degradation jeopardizes the health of 3.2 billion people, while over 2 billion live in water-stressed regions. Pollution of soil, air, and water is a leading environmental cause of disease, contributing to over 9 million premature deaths annually. Soil contamination stems from heavy metals, synthetic chemicals, pesticides, and plastics, driven by industrial activity, agriculture, and waste mismanagement. These pollutants induce oxidative stress, inflammation, and hormonal disruption, significantly increasing risks for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Emerging contaminants like micro- and nanoplastics amplify health risks through cellular damage, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular dysfunction. Urbanization and climate change exacerbate soil degradation through deforestation, overfertilization, and pollution, further threatening ecosystem sustainability and human health. Mitigation efforts, such as reducing chemical exposure, adopting sustainable land-use practices, and advancing urban planning, have shown promise in lowering pollution-related health impacts. Public health initiatives, stricter pollution controls, and lifestyle interventions, including antioxidant-rich diets, can also mitigate risks. Pollution remains preventable, as demonstrated by high-income nations implementing cost-effective solutions. Policies like the European Commission's Zero-Pollution Vision aim to reduce pollution to safe levels by 2050, promoting sustainable ecosystems and public health. Addressing soil pollution is critical to combating the global burden of NCDs, particularly CVDs, and fostering a healthier environment for future generations.
40074454	Mass spectrometric monitoring of redox transformation and arylation of tryptophan.	Tryptophan (Trp) is an essential amino acid obtained from human diet. It is involved not only in de novo biosynthesis of proteins but also in complex metabolic pathways. Redox transformation of tryptophan is under-explored in comparison with kynurenine, serotonin and indole pyruvate pathways. We described herein a mass spectrometric approach that can not only detect electron transfer-associated changes in masses and charges, but also identify electron-directed bond cleavages and radical-radical cross-coupling reactions in redox transformation of tryptophan. Photoactive TiO<sub>2</sub> that is widely applied in cosmetic products is used as electron donor and receptor because of the capability to generate photoelectrons and holes. It was demonstrated tryptophan undergoes redox transformation through the removal of an electron from amino nitrogen atom by hole oxidization along with an electron capture in the indole ring. The back and forth electron-shuttle converts electric energy into chemical energy that enforces bond cleavages. Sodium-coupled electron transfer (SCET) was found in complementary with proton-coupled electron transfer in tryptophan. The movement of sodium ions avoids electric charge buildup caused by electron transfer. Various redox products were detected on both light irradiated TiO<sub>2</sub> and skins, among which β-carboline shows extensive radical scavenging ability for diverse cross-coupling with indole derivatives. Light-independent redox products have been detected in vivo such as in mouse brain, indicating the presence of in vivo electron transfer-directed redox transformation. It has also been revealed that tryptophan can be arylated on C<sub>α</sub> and C<sub>β</sub> atoms in response to the exposure of halogenated aromatics.
40074108	Discovery of novel seven-membered ring derivatives of ONC212 as caseinolytic protease P protein activators using the ring expansion strategy: Rational design, synthesis, and antibacterial evaluation.	Caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) protein is essential for prokaryotic and eukaryotic protein homeostasis, and has emerged as a promising bactericidal target for controlling bacterial infection and evading the emergent of drug-resistance risk. As the unique bactericidal mechanism, ClpP loses its substrate specificity and undergoes uncontrolled protein hydrolysis in the presence of an activator, leading to causing bacterial death. To further expand the chemotype of ClpP activator, a series of ONC212 derivatives were synthesized using a ring expansion strategy. Surprisingly, compound A<sub>14</sub> showed optimal antibacterial activity against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in vitro (EC<sub>50</sub> value = 3.86 μg/mL), which was >6 × more potent than the EC<sub>50</sub> value of ONC212 (26.42 μg/mL). Molecular docking, fluorescence titration and degradation experiments of the XooFtsZ protein indicated that compound A<sub>14</sub> was a strong degrader of XooClpP towards XooFtsZ. In vivo assays showed that the control activity of compound A<sub>14</sub> (200 μg/mL) reached 47.47 %, compared to 41.57 %, 36.72 %, and 30.43 % for ONC212, thiodiazole copper, and bismerthiazol, respectively. Overall, this study led to the identification compound A<sub>14</sub>, which not only showed improved antibacterial potency, and maintained the binding XooClpP, but also highlighted the ring expansion strategy as a promising approach for bactericide discovery.
40073787	Detritivore identity modulates effects of nutrient enrichment and a common fungicide presence on leaf litter decomposition and fungal community.	Understanding the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors on ecosystem function is crucial for freshwater ecosystem management, However, the influence of nutrient enrichment, fungicide presence, and detritivore identity on leaf litter decomposition and associated fungal communities remains poorly understood. We conducted a microcosm experiment to examine: 1) the individual and combined effects of nutrient enrichment and a common fungicide on leaf litter decomposition and fungal communities; and 2) how two types of detritivore invertebrates (scrapers vs. shredders) influence these effects. After 35 days, we assessed: 1) leaf litter decomposition, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production, and the activities of extracellular enzymes; and 2) the diversity, community structure, and co-occurrence networks of fungal communities. We found that both fungicides and nutrient enrichment increased enzymatic activity but did not significantly impact fungal diversity. However, fungicides changed fungal community structure and reduced detritivore-mediated decomposition and DOC production, while nutrient enrichment had the opposite effect. In combination, nutrient enrichment mitigated the negative effects of fungicides on fungal co-occurrence network stability and decomposition. We found that detritivore identity selectively influenced fungal taxa, resulting in distinct co-occurrence patterns under different stressors. The effects of nutrient enrichment and/or fungicide on leaf litter decomposition also depended on detritivore identity. This research underscores the pivotal role of detritivore identity and the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping fungal communities and modulating leaf litter decomposition, particularly in multiple stressors settings, and its implications for effective management and biodiversity conservation.
40073769	Study of feed intake rate as a physiological biomarker in Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus 1758) under Chlorpyrifos and Cypermethrin exposure.	Chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin are the two most extensively applied insecticides in agricultural areas across the world and are found to contaminate adjacent water bodies, posing risks to non-target aquatic organisms, including fish. Aquaculture is primarily concerned with the feeding and growth of fish. This study evaluated the effects of sub-lethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin on the physiological biomarker 'feed intake rate' of Oreochromis niloticus through 96 h static renewal bioassays. The fish were fed a formulated diet containing 30 % crude protein at 5 % of their body weight per day. The feed intake rate calculation was based on the outcome of 6 h feeding of fish carried out in glass aquariums. Uneaten diets (leftovers) were carefully collected and dried, and the weight of the uneaten diets was subtracted from the total amount of dry feed delivered to determine the actual feed intake rate. In the present study, the actual feed intake rates in O. niloticus exposed to chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin varied from 3.06 ± 0.02 to 3.92 ± 0.02 g/100 g BW/d and from 3.32 ± 0.02 to 4.02 ± 0.01 g/100 g BW/d, respectively. Feeding rates and growth of O. niloticus decreased in all sub-lethal concentrations of both test pesticides when compared to the control. Even at a sub-lethal concentration of 5 μg/L chlorpyrifos and 0.5 μg/L cypermethrin, O. niloticus lost its appetite. It can be concluded that chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin even in low concentrations (μg/L) in aquatic media can affect the feed intake rate and growth in fish.
40073671	Novel fluorescence-based and portable detection platforms using nitrogen-doped carbon dots for environmental monitoring of dichloran fungicide.	A novel fluorescence sensor utilizing label-free nitrogen self-doped carbon dots (NCDs) was developed for the sensitive, selective, and rapid determination of dichloran fungicide, popularly used in agricultural and horticultural fields. The NCDs were prepared from maleic anhydride and diethylenetriamine via a one-step pyrolysis process. They demonstrated strong blue fluorescence emission with a quantum yield of 12 %. With the addition of dichloran, the fluorescence emission of NCDs was quenched, attributed to the inner filter effect and dynamic quenching. They demonstrated outstanding sensitivity to dichloran with a linear range between 1.0 and 50.0 µM and a remarkably low detection limit of 7.6 nM, the best reported date. The sensing process could be repeatedly and rapidly generated within 30 s. Additionally, the NCDs exhibited selectivity towards dichloran amidst interferences, including common metal ions, organic chemicals, and other fungicides. The detection of dichloran in carrots, grapes, and drinking water was successfully accomplished using NCDs, yielding satisfactory recovery results ranging between 95.1 and 108.7 %. Moreover, a paper-based sensor based on NCDs as sensing probes was demonstrated to observe the fluorescence quenching towards dichloran, with a detection limit of 4.24 µM. It also showed high efficacy in distinguishing and selectively detecting dichloran against interferences. Therefore, this work contributes to the development of efficient and portable detection platforms with applications in environmental monitoring and agricultural fields.
40073482	Filament-woven SF/PA gel for removing ultrafine nanoparticles and unmanageable hazardous pollutants by "all-in-one net".	The current state of the world's water resources is facing serious challenges, and the current water purification processes are designed for a single, more specific contaminant, with more stringent constraints, which are not suitable for emergency water treatment in stochastic environment and may cause secondary pollution. It is necessary to provide a water purification method that is convenient, easy-to-operate, one-step treatment of multiple pollutants. Herein, silk fibroin (SF) that extracted from discarded silkworm cocoons and recycled silk and phytic acid (PA) are "woven" into a network structure through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction to form a unique gel, which could be used to remove different pollutants by "sweeping and catching" and physical adsorption. SF/PA gels have been demonstrated to adsorb more than 99.9% of ultrafine nanoparticles in water, and many unmanageable hazardous pollutants can also be removed by "All-in-one Net", including bacteria, polystyrene microsphere, insoluble antibiotics and pesticides. In addition, SF/PA gel from waste resources can not only achieve the purpose of treating waste with waste, but also the products after removal of pollutants can be reused as biochar-based fertilizer to improve the soil environment. This process established a sustainable closed-loop system without secondary pollution, providing an excellent scheme for the sustainable use of resources.
40073479	Degradative removal of diclofenac from wastewater - Statistical and analytical approaches to understand degradation pathways.	In environmental management area, quality of water is a major growing concern with the emerging contaminants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals likely to be present at low concentrations in water bodies, thereby potentially harming the ecosystem and human health. Diclofenac (DCF), a commonly used drug, has been found in wastewater, surface water, and drinking water sources, whose elimination can be a challenge issue. This study investigates the elimination of DCF by the photochemical method from aqueous media using short-wavelength radiation and hydrogen peroxide. A statistical approach is used to optimize and evaluate the effects of experimental parameters on the degradation of DCF. A quadratic model was proposed to predict the response to variations in three key parameters viz., initial DCF concentration, pH of the solution, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration. The suggested model shows a high coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9961), indicating that observed data is replicated by modelled data. The findings suggest that pH of the solution is the most significant factor affecting the degradation process. Furthermore, a strong interaction between initial concentrations of DCF and hydrogen peroxide is observed. Complete degradation of DCF is achieved within 90 min under the optimal conditions (pH = 4, [DCF]<sub>0</sub> = 20 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, and [hydrogen peroxide]<sub>0</sub> = 600 mg L<sup>-1</sup>). This is the first of its kind of study to identify the reaction intermediates using the solid phase extraction (SPE), a pre-concentration step via evaporation with a gentle stream of nitrogen, and direct infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (DI-HRMS) to detect trace level reaction intermediates. The study follows the United Nations SDGs # 7 program dealing with clean water production. The possible degradation pathways of DCF are proposed.
40073365	Design, Synthesis, and Nematicidal Activity of Novel Amide Derivatives Containing an 1,2,4/1,3,4-Oxadiazole Moiety against <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>.	To discover novel structural nematicides, 79 amide compounds containing 1,2,4/1,3,4-oxadiazole moiety were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for nematicidal efficacy against second-stage juveniles of <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i> (<i>B. xylophilus</i>). Notably, some compounds exhibited superior nematicidal efficacy, for example, the LC<sub>50</sub> values of compounds <b>11</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>49</b>, <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>54</b> were 7.4, 31.0, 35.3, 10.3, 12.7, 6.9, 21.5, and 52.2 mg/L, respectively, with nematicidal activities significantly surpassing that of tioxazafen (79.3 mg/L). Compound <b>51</b> exhibited multifaceted nematicidal activity through suppression of motility, feeding, and reproduction, combined with induction of oxidative stress. Compound <b>51</b> significantly reduced nematode protein content and impaired antioxidant capacity. Meanwhile, compound <b>51</b> demonstrates superior binding energy and interaction mode with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), showing potent SDH inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> = 15.0 μmol/L). Therefore, compound <b>51</b>, which may become a potential SDH inhibitor, interferes with nematode energy metabolism by inhibiting SDH activity, resulting in nematode death.
40073123	Indoloquinoline alkaloid neocryptolepine derivative inhibits <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> by targeting thiamine thiazole synthase.	The emergence and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> strains pose a great challenge to the quality and safety of agricultural products and the efficient use of pesticides. Previously unidentified fungicides and targets are urgently needed to combat <i>B. cinerea</i>-associated infections as alternative therapeutic options. In this study, the promising compound Z24 demonstrated efficacy against all tested plant pathogenic fungi. Thiamine thiazole synthase (Bcthi4) was identified as a target protein of Z24 by drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Molecular docking and enzyme activity experiments have demonstrated that Z24 can affect the function of Bcthi4. Last, mechanistic studies show that Z24 inhibits thiamine biosynthesis by binding to Bcthi4 and induces up-regulation of alternative splicing [alternative 5' splice site (A5SS)] of the <i>Bcthi4</i> gene. In conclusion, by targeting Bcthi4, Z24 has the potential to be developed as a previously unidentified anti-<i>B. cinerea</i> candidate.
40073043	Evaluation of long lasting insecticidal nets in experimental huts and WHO PQT/VCP compliance: A systematic review.	Malaria control in highly endemic regions relies heavily on vector control tools, particularly LLINs. The effectiveness of LLINs varies by eco-epidemiological conditions and brands. A comprehensive review of WHO interim-approved LLIN brands is necessary to address this variability. This systematic review screened 145 articles, refining them to 27 eligible publications, to assess the efficacy of WHO-recommended LLINs, focusing on synthetic pyrethroids and synergists like Piperonyl Butoxide or Pyriproxyfen. The review demonstrated that LLINs impregnated with synthetic pyrethroids, especially when used with synergists, are more effective than regular LLINs. However, adherence to WHO PQT/VCP (World Health Organization Prequalification Unit/Vector Control Product) checklists was inconsistent. Several LLIN pairs which includes candidate and comparator nets showed equal efficacy (100% in both arms), including Olyset Plus vs. Olyset Net, DuraNet vs. PermaNet 3.0, Interceptor G2 vs. Interceptor, MagNet vs. DuraNet, Dawa Plus 3.0 vs. Dawa Plus 2.0, and Veerralin vs. PermaNet 3.0 in terms of mosquito mortality. Significant efficacy differences were noted between various bed net pairs: Interceptor vs CTN (RR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.28-1.66); Olyset Net Duo vs Olyset Net (RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18); ICON Maxx vs CTN polyester (RR: 7.7, 95% CI: 3.6-16.31); Dawa Plus 3.0 vs Dawa Plus 2.0 (RR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.34-3.15); Interceptor G2 vs Interceptor G1 (RR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.77-0.96). These findings inform the development of improved net designs and ensure alignment with WHO guidelines, enhancing vector control measures. The review supports improved malaria control strategies and sustained LLIN utilization, highlighting the need for LLIN manufacturers to align with WHO guidelines.
40073014	Lipid nanocarrier containing eugenol for denture hygiene: evaluation of efficacy against Candida biofilms.	This article is derived from Irisvaldo Lima Guedes's Master's dissertation and is available at the address: https://sigaa.ufpi.br/sigaa/public/programa/noticias_desc.jsf?lc=pt_BR&id=370&noticia=519307121 Eugenol has demonstrated efficacy against Candida spp., which is highly prevalent in denture wearers. However, the low water solubility and high volatility limit its application. The encapsulation in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) may be a viable approach for developing new sanitizing agents for denture hygiene.
40072826	Re-Evaluating the Use of Glyphosate-based Herbicides: Implications on Fertility.	Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most widely used herbicides in the United States, accounting for 19% of estimated global use. Although the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reaffirmed that the active ingredient glyphosate (GLY) is safe for humans, recent studies on exposure have suggested association with cancer, metabolic disorders, endocrine disruption and infertility, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and psychological disorders. Current literature on the effects of GLY exposure on reproductive function suggests potential clinical implications on women's reproductive health, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, infertility, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The continued debate surrounding GLY exposure increasingly exemplifies the public health issue surrounding its consequences on female reproductive health, human fertility, and the potential epigenetic effects. In this review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of toxicity and endocrine disruption of GLY on the female reproductive tract and highlight possible implications of GLY exposure on reproductive health outcomes. GLY adversely affects the female reproductive system through increased oxidative stress, endocrine disruption of reproductive hormones, histological changes in ovarian and uterus tissue, and diminished ovarian function in human cell lines and animals. We conclude that increased research efforts are warranted regarding the safety and efficacy of GBH as it pertains to female reproduction, as well as investments in cost-effective alternatives with the potential to reduce GBH usage.
40072761	Environmental ototoxicants: an update.	Approximately 5 years ago, we proposed the establishment of a new category of ototoxicants: environmental ototoxicants, in addition to the recognized categories of occupational and drug-related ototoxicants. Since the publication of our review, the scientific literature has confirmed the potential for hearing impairment (HI) caused by the general population's exposure to various chemicals. However, the extent of this exposure's contribution to the global incidence of hearing loss (HL) has yet to be estimated. Due to the growing health, financial, and social challenges related to HL in the general population, we have reviewed the literature on HL in individuals exposed to environmental chemicals. Additionally, we have broadened the list of environmental ototoxicants to include several previously recognized as occupational ototoxicants. These substances include the following: organophosphate insecticides (OPIs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs): hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), dieldrin, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB); pyrethroids, bisphenol A (BPA), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), triclosan (TCS), parabens (PBs), per- and polyfluorinated compounds (PFCs), metals and trace elements (such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), barium (Ba), and arsenic (As)), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), styrene. Additionally, we have included alcohol, which is widely consumed and known for its ototoxic effects.
40072757	Assessment of the endectocide efficacy of a pour-on topical solution containing fluazuron, fipronil and eprinomectin in cattle.	The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new formulation composed of the chemical active ingredients benzoylphenylurea, phenylpyrazole and macrocyclic lactone, which have different mechanisms of action on the most important parasites, such as R. microplus, H. irritans, D. hominis larvae, C. hominivorax larvae and nematodes. The six experiments were conducted in Formiga (Bananal and Bela Vista farms) in the Center-West region of Minas Gerais, Brazil. This study introduces a new topical formulation containing 3.0% Fluazuron, 1.25% Fipronil, and 0.5% Eprinomectin, which has demonstrated high efficacy against R. microplus in both natural (97%) and experimental (95%) infestations. Additionally, the formulation was effective as a larvicide against D. hominis (98%) and C. hominivorax (100%), as well as against H. irritans (98%) and as an anthelmintic (97%). Its broad-spectrum activity and prolonged efficacy make it a tool for managing parasitic infestations in cattle. However, the potential for resistance development and the need for strategic application highlight the importance of integrated control programs that combine chemical and nonchemical approaches to ensure sustainable parasite management.
40072732	PET Coordination Mechanism for the Detecting of Environmental Toxic Analytes: Current Approaches and Future Directions.	Fluorescence-based photoinduced electron transfer (PET) has garnered significant attention in the molecular recognition field in recent years because of its unique and desirable photophysical properties. Recent advancements in PET-based chemosensors have demonstrated their potential for real-time monitoring of pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and organic contaminants in various environmental matrices. This review emphasizes the recent advancements in fluorogenic and chromogenic PET-based chemosensors based on Anthracene, Imidazole, Indole, Pyrrole, Thiazole, Naphthalene, Quinoline, Calix[4]arene, Fluorescein, Quantum Dots, Schiff base compounds and also focusing on their molecular design, sensing mechanisms, and photophysical properties reported from the year 2011 to 2024.
40072721	Differential Responses of the Egg-Larval Parasitoid Chelonus Bifoveolatus To Fall Armyworm-Induced and Constitutive Volatiles of Diverse Maize Genotypes.	The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, is a serious invasive crop pest and threat to food security. Conventional pest control approaches using chemical pesticides can lead to adverse environmental and human health problems calling for safer alternative pest management options. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by plants constitutively and in response to herbivory have been shown to enhance ecologically benign biocontrol alternatives to chemical insecticides for pest management. However, genotypic variations in VOC emissions have also been reported for plant species including maize (Zea mays). Hence, a better insight into the variations in odor profiles of different maize varieties and their corresponding role in recruiting pests' natural enemies are crucial for developing a sustainable biocontrol strategy. Our present study assessed the behavioral responses of the FAW egg-larval parasitoid, Chelonus bifoveolatus (Braconidae: Hymenoptera), to constitutive and induced volatiles from different maize landraces (Jowi Red, Nyamula) and hybrids (SC Duma, DK 777) grown in Kenya and compared their volatile profiles. In a four-arm olfactometer, female parasitoid wasps were significantly attracted to FAW oviposition-induced VOCs from SC Duma and Nyamula. Chemical analysis of test plant volatiles revealed significant variation in the quantity and quality of key bioactive VOCs such as (E)-2-hexenal, α-pinene, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, α-copaene, (E)-β-farnesene and (E, E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene. Our findings provide more insights into genetic variation in VOCs emission across maize genotypes and the corresponding differences in attraction of pest natural enemies that provide indirect defense. As such, these traits could be exploited to enhance ecologically sustainable pest management strategies.
40072686	Impact of Control Interventions on Malaria Incidence in the General Population of Mali.	The increase in malaria incidence and the reduction of funding for malaria control have highlighted the need to step up efforts in the fight against malaria in Mali. To further refine the malaria control strategy implemented in the country, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of control interventions at the health district level on malaria incidence in the general population.
40072463	Effectiveness of flumioxazin alone and in combination with other herbicides for controlling different weed emergence patterns and species.	Effective weed management is essential for maximizing sugarcane productivity, with pre-emergence herbicides representing a fundamental strategy for controlling weed infestations. The study evaluates the efficacy of flumioxazin, alone and combined with other herbicides, for weed control in sugarcane. A greenhouse experiments assessed control of various weed species: <i>Rottboellia cochinchinensis</i>, <i>Urochloa decumbens</i>, <i>Digitaria horizontalis</i>, <i>Merremia aegyptia</i>, <i>Merremia cissoides</i>, and <i>Ipomoea triloba</i>. The completely randomized 9 × 5 factorial design with four replications with nine herbicide treatments and five sowing intervals, applied in pots containing a dystrophic Red Latosol. Evaluations included percentage control at 35 d after application (DAA) and reduction in dry mass. Results showed flumioxazin alone had variable efficacy, with high initial effectiveness but significant decline over time. In contrast, combinations such as flumioxazin + metribuzin and flumioxazin + diclosulam maintained high efficacy (>90%) throughout all periods. Flumioxazin + isoxaflutole was initially effective but diminished after 20 DAA. Combinations with herbicides of similar half-lives, like metribuzin, suggested synergistic effects, while pairings with longer half-life herbicides, like imazapic, complemented flumioxazin's action. Mixtures of flumioxazin with other herbicides effectively reduced weed dry mass, highlighting the advantage of herbicide combinations for sustained and efficient weed management in sugarcane cultivation. This study emphasizes the importance of herbicide combinations in overcoming management challenges and selecting appropriate herbicides for diverse field conditions.
40071638	Synthesis, Antifungal Activity and In Silico Study of Novel Quinoline Thioether Derivatives Inspired by Natural Quinoline.	Inspired by natural quinoline, a series of novel quinoline derivatives containing thioether groups were designed and synthesized. All target compounds were characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS. Their antifungal activities were evaluated in vitro against ten phytopathogenic fungi. Among the synthesized compounds, 3l (4-(allylthio)-8-fluoro-2,3-dimethylquinoline) exhibited significant antifungal activity, with inhibition rates exceeding 80% against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Physalospora piricola at 50 μg/mL. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis revealed that the presence of an alkene group in the thioether side chain enhanced antifungal activity. Molecular docking studies with Pyricularia oryzae dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PoDHODH) indicated that 3l forms a hydrogen bond with His89, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the electronic properties of the compounds. Additionally, ADMET predictions suggested that 3l has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, similar to the commercial fungicide tebufloquin. These findings highlight the potential of 3l as a lead compound for further development of novel antifungal agents.
40071309	Tracking malathion resistance in Spanish Ceratitis capitata populations: prevalence of resistance alleles/haplotypes before and after the withdrawal of malathion.	Field resistance to malathion was reported for Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), Ceratitis capitata, populations collected in Spain in 2004 and 2005, when medfly control mainly relied on malathion bait sprays. The mutation G328A in the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene (Ccace2) was then identified as the main resistance mechanism in a field-derived resistant strain. However, outdoor plant protection products containing malathion were withdrawn from the European Union in 2009 and other insecticides gained importance, such as spinosad and pyrethroids, though other organophosphates were occasionally used for medfly control for a few years.
40071224	Virucidal and Bactericidal Properties of Biocompatible Copper Textiles.	The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the global threat posed by emerging viruses, emphasizing the critical need for effective strategies to combat pathogen transmission. Moreover, alongside emerging viruses, the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance further reinforces the need to develop novel methods for infection control. Anti-pathogenic coatings on textiles offer a promising solution; in this study, three electroless copper-plated fabrics are evaluated for their antipathogenic properties following International Standards Organisation (ISO) standards. Prior to electroless plating, materials are activated either by immersion in a Pd catalyst solution (material A) or by ink-jet printing Cu/Ag catalyst along the weft (material B) or warp thread (material C). This study demonstrates that activation method influences the materials antipathogenic performance, with all materials achieving complete bactericidal/fungicidal neutralization within 30 min of incubation. Material B exhibits up to 4-log virucidal effects within 1 h against viruses such as coronavirus (OC43, 229E), Influenza A (H1N1), and Rotavirus A. Furthermore, biocompatibility testing indicates that material B exhibited low in vitro cytotoxicity. Textile B demonstrates strong antibacterial results even after one year of accelerated aging with no significant difference (<i>P</i> = 0.74) in efficiency against MRSA, highlighting promising applications for infection control in clinical settings reducing pathogen transmission, nosocomial infections and the associated economic burden.
40071128	Unlocking the potential of ecofriendly guardians for biological control of plant diseases, crop protection and production in sustainable agriculture.	Several beneficial microbial strains inhibit the growth of different phytopathogens and commercialized worldwide as biocontrol agents (BCAs) for plant disease management. These BCAs employ different strategies for growth inhibition of pathogens, which includes production of antibiotics, siderophores, lytic enzymes, bacteriocins, hydrogen cyanide, volatile organic compounds, biosurfactants and induction of systemic resistance. The efficacy of antagonistic strains could be further improved through genetic engineering for better disease suppression in sustainable farming practices. Some antagonistic microbial strains also possess plant-growth-promoting activities and their inoculation improved plant growth in addition to disease suppression. This review discusses the characterization of antagonistic microbes and their antimicrobial metabolites, and the application of these BCAs for disease control. The present review also provides a comprehensive summary of the genetic organization and regulation of the biosynthesis of different antimicrobial metabolites in antagonistic strains. Use of molecular engineering to improve production of metabolites in BCAs and their efficacy in disease control is also discussed. The application of these biopesticides will reduce use of conventional pesticides in disease control and help in achieving sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural systems.
40071038	Crystal structure and Hirshfeld-surface analysis of the pesticide etoxazole.	Etoxazole (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>23</sub>F<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>), systematic name 4-(4-<i>tert</i>-butyl-2-eth-oxy-phen-yl)-2-(2,6-di-fluoro-phen-yl)-4,5-di-hydro-1,3-oxazole, is a fluorinated insecticide and acaricide that inhibits chitin biosynthesis, disrupting insect development by preventing proper exoskeleton formation. Widely used in agriculture since 1998, it is readily absorbed by plant tissues and translocates within leaves. Metabolic studies have identified several oxidative degradation products, while toxicol-ogical assessments have examined potential effects, including oxidative stress. This study presents a detailed crystallographic and Hirshfeld surface analysis of etoxazole. The mol-ecule consists of a central di-hydro-oxazole ring flanked by 2,6-di-fluoro-phenyl and 4-<i>tert</i>-butyl-2-eth-oxy-phenyl groups, each twisted relative to the oxazole core. The di-hydro-oxazole ring is nearly planar, with the substituted phenyl rings forming dihedral angles of 44.20 (4)° and 47.87 (4)° with the mean plane of the di-hydro-oxazole. The eth-oxy group exhibits a dihedral angle of 15.04 (11)° to the <i>tert</i>-butyl-phenyl ring, while the <i>tert</i>-butyl group itself shows minor torsional disorder [major:minor occupancies are 0.760 (6):0.240 (6)]. The mol-ecular packing is dominated by van der Waals-type inter-actions, though weak C-H⋯F and C-H⋯O inter-actions lead to pleated layers parallel to the <i>ab</i> plane, which further stack along the <i>c</i>-axis direction. A Hirshfeld surface analysis confirms the prevalence of van der Waals inter-actions in crystal stabilization.
40071033	Modification of the existing maximum residue level for metalaxyl-M in honey.	In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant Ascenza Agro S.A. submitted a request to the competent national authority in France to modify the existing maximum residue level (MRL) for the active substance metalaxyl-M in honey. The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposal for honey. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of metalaxyl-M in honey matrix at the validated limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concluded that the short-term and long-term intake of residues expected in honey resulting from the existing uses of metalaxyl-M on melliferous crops reported by the Applicant is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health.
40071031	Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance maltodextrin.	The conclusions of the EFSA following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authorities of the rapporteur Member State, Ireland, and co-rapporteur Member State, France, for the pesticide active substance maltodextrin and the considerations as regards the inclusion of the substance in Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2020/103. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of maltodextrin as an insecticide and acaricide on all edible and non-edible crops. The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are reported where identified.
40070979	[Entomological investigation during the chikungunya epidemic in Chad in 2020].	The aim of this study was to identify chikungunya vectors and study their bioecology in order to contribute to the response to the 2020 epidemic in the cities of Abéché and Biltine in eastern Chad.
40070568	Fenvalerate exposure induces AKT/AMPK-dependent alterations in glucose metabolism in hepatoma cells.	Fenvalerate (Fen) is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Tumor cells exhibit a shift in glucose metabolism, known as the Warburg effect. Accordingly, we aimed to elucidate whether Fen interferes with insulin signaling and affects hepatoma cell metabolism.
40070546	Identification, Phylogeny, and Fungicide Sensitivity of Oomycota Species Causing Stem and Root Rots on Chrysanthemums in Korea.	Root and stem rot, caused by Pythiales (Oomycota), poses a significant threat to chrysanthemum (<i>Chrysanthemum</i> spp.) cultivation worldwide. In Korea, previously undocumented rot and blight symptoms were observed on stems, roots, and leaves of <i>Chrysanthemum morifolium</i> (=<i>Dendranthema morifolium</i>), a chrysanthemum species with high global production. This study identified the causal agents as <i>Globisporangium ultimum</i> and <i>Phytopythium helicoides</i> based on morphological features and molecular phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer rDNA (ITS) region and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit mtDNA (<i>cox</i>1 and <i>cox</i>2) genes. Pathogenicity assay demonstrated the high aggressiveness of both species toward chrysanthemums. Fungicide sensitivity testing revealed high sensitivity to picarbutrazox, highlighting its potential as an effective control measure. These findings enhance our knowledge of identifying and managing <i>G. ultimum</i> and <i>P. helicoides</i> in chrysanthemum cultivation.
40070454	Unsupervised semantic label generation in agricultural fields.	Robust perception systems allow farm robots to recognize weeds and vegetation, enabling the selective application of fertilizers and herbicides to mitigate the environmental impact of traditional agricultural practices. Today's perception systems typically rely on deep learning to interpret sensor data for tasks such as distinguishing soil, crops, and weeds. These approaches usually require substantial amounts of manually labeled training data, which is often time-consuming and requires domain expertise. This paper aims to reduce this limitation and propose an automated labeling pipeline for crop-weed semantic image segmentation in managed agricultural fields. It allows the training of deep learning models without or with only limited manual labeling of images. Our system uses RGB images recorded with unmanned aerial or ground robots operating in the field to produce semantic labels exploiting the field row structure for spatially consistent labeling. We use the rows previously detected to identify multiple crop rows, reducing labeling errors and improving consistency. We further reduce labeling errors by assigning an "unknown" class to challenging-to-segment vegetation. We use evidential deep learning because it provides predictions uncertainty estimates that we use to refine and improve our predictions. In this way, the evidential deep learning assigns high uncertainty to the weed class, as it is often less represented in the training data, allowing us to use the uncertainty to correct the semantic predictions. Experimental results suggest that our approach outperforms general-purpose labeling methods applied to crop fields by a large margin and domain-specific approaches on multiple fields and crop species. Using our generated labels to train deep learning models boosts our prediction performance on previously unseen fields with respect to unseen crop species, growth stages, or different lighting conditions. We obtain an IoU of 88.6% on crops, and 22.7% on weeds for a managed field of sugarbeets, where fully supervised methods have 83.4% on crops and 33.5% on weeds and other unsupervised domain-specific methods get 54.6% on crops and 11.2% on weeds. Finally, our method allows fine-tuning models trained in a fully supervised fashion to improve their performance in unseen field conditions up to +17.6% in mean IoU without additional manual labeling.
40070273	Investigating the genomic and biochemical effects of dalapon on antioxidant systems in zebrafish, <i>Danio rerio</i>.	This research explored the effects of dalapon exposure on the expression of various genes, including <i>cat</i>, <i>sod1</i>, <i>sod2</i>, <i>sod3a</i>, <i>sod3b</i>, <i>gpx1a</i>, <i>gpx3</i>, <i>gpx4a</i>, <i>gpx4b</i>, <i>gpx7</i>, <i>gpx8</i>, <i>gpx9</i>, <i>gstr</i>, <i>g6pd</i>, and <i>gsr</i>, along with the activities of related antioxidant enzymes (AEs), such as CAT, SOD, GPX, G6PD, GST, and GR in zebrafish. Kidney and liver tissues were analyzed to assess oxidative stress levels. Results indicated that both the concentration of dalapon (25 and 50 ppm) and the duration of exposure had a significant effect on AE activities and gene expression. RT-PCR analysis suggested that changes in gene expression among dalapon-exposed zebrafish might indicate a rapid response to pesticide-induced stress. Moreover, the activities of CAT, G6PD, and GST increased in response to dalapon exposure at the specified concentrations. In contrast, prolonged exposure exceeding 72 h led to significantly higher malondialdehyde levels in liver and kidney tissues compared to the control group. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of antioxidant enzymes in oxidative stress and provide important insights for developing aquaculture breeding programs focused on improving fish stress tolerance. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis and conserved gene synteny analysis confirmed that the antioxidant enzyme genes in zebrafish are orthologous to those found in other model organisms, such as medaka and stickleback. Consequently, these results could be beneficial for other vertebrate species.
40070230	Copper-catalyzed chemoselective C-H functionalization/dearomatization sequence: direct access to indole-based spirocyclic scaffolds.	Herein, a copper-catalyzed intermolecular [4+1] spiroannulation of indoles with alkynyldiazoketones affording various indole-based spirocyclic molecules <i>via</i> a chemoselective C-H functionalization/dearomatization sequence was developed.
40070052	Screening and Identification of Biocontrol Bacteria for Anthracnose in Mahonia eurybracteata Fedde.	Mahonia eurybracteata exhibits characteristics related to heat dissipation, nutritional supplementation, and possesses antimicrobial and anticancer properties. Despite its widespread cultivation through artificial means, the detrimental impact of anthracnose on its growth has led to extensive reliance on chemical pesticides for disease control. Unscientific pesticide application and the use of outdated spraying techniques contribute to the presence of pesticide residues in both plants and the environment, thereby posing potential risks. This study utilized tissue isolation to segregate the pathogenic fungus causing anthracnose. The isolated strains, identified through 18S rRNA, were identified as Colletotrichum fructicola and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Koch's postulates were employed to confirm the pathogenicity of these strains. Simultaneously, soil samples from the rhizosphere of healthy M. eurybracteata were collected. Using the dilution plate method, 14 bacterial strains were isolated, and molecular biology techniques were employed for preliminary and subsequent screening via the agar confrontation method. Results indicated that selected strains of Pseudomonas gessardii and Pseudomonas fluorescens exhibited inhibitory effects on C. fructicola and C. gloeosporioides, respectively. Through in vitro detached leaf experiments, the biocontrol effectiveness of these two bacterial strains was validated. This study establishes a theoretical foundation for the development and application of antagonistic bacteria.
40069737	Acute and chronic pesticide exposure trigger fundamentally different molecular responses in bumble bee brains.	Beneficial insects, including pollinators, encounter various pesticide exposure conditions, from brief high-concentration acute exposure to continuous low-level chronic exposure. To effectively assess the environmental risks of pesticides, it is critical to understand how different exposure schemes influence their effects. Unfortunately, this knowledge remains limited. To clarify whether different exposure schemes disrupt the physiology of pollinators in a similar manner, we exposed bumble bees to acute or chronic treatments of three different pesticides: acetamiprid, clothianidin, or sulfoxaflor. Genome-wide gene expression profiling enabled us to compare the effects of these treatments on the brain in a high-resolution manner.
40069678	Bioactives derived from Brazilian native flora with antimicrobial and anticancer activity.	The development of new drugs that act against multidrug-resistant microorganisms and malignant tumors is necessary owing to the limited therapeutic options and high mortality rates associated with these pathologies. In this study, we evaluated the phytochemical groups present in seven plants from the Brazilian Cerrado even as their antioxidant, antiproliferative and antimicrobial activities.
40069640	Evaluation of phytochemicals and essential oils of Cupressus semprevirens in controlling cattle tick Rhipicephalus annulatus (Acari: Ixodidae).	Cupressus sempervirens is one of the conifer plants, that is used as an antimicrobial, antioxidant, anthelminthic, and many other health purposes. Rhipicephalus annulatus is one of the hard tick genera affecting the production and health of domestic animals in Egypt. Extensive use of chemical acaricides in the management of ticks caused acaricide resistance, environmental contamination, residues in meat and milk, and harmful effects on non-target species. For these reasons, there is an urgent need to create efficient, environmentally friendly acaricides. This work aimed to assay the essential oils and establish the phytochemical analysis of C. sempervirens extract, its effects against the semi-engorged females of R. annulatus, and discuss their possible control effects.
40069633	Effects of different concentrations of chlormequat chloride on bacterial community composition and diversity in peanut soil.	The application of pesticides may have significant impacts on soil environment and communities. In order to understand the deep relationship between the application of chlormequat chloride (CC) and the bacterial community in peanut soil, high-resolution characterization was performed using peanut soil samples (12 points; 0-20 cm rhizosphere soil) from untreated and sprayed with different concentrations of CC. Experimental data showed that with the increase of concentration, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) richness showed a decreasing tendency. The OTUs richness at low concentration (D, 50% CC diluted 5000 times, 45 g ai/ha), medium concentration (M, 50% CC diluted 300 times, 75 g ai/ha), and high concentration (G, 50% CC diluted 1000 times, 225 g ai/ha) were 5583, 5430, and 3910, respectively. Low concentrations increased the composition and relative abundance of soil bacterial communities. In contrast, high concentrations significantly reduced bacterial diversity. As the concentration of CC increases, the abundance of Proteobacteria decreases, while the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increases. The number of Acidobacterium and Bacteroidetes increased in groups D and M, while it decreased in group G. D, M and G groups showed a decrease in the abundance of Pseudomonas, polaromonas, and Azovibrio compared to CK, while the abundance of Flavobacterium increased. In addition, the abundance of Rahnella1 decreased in groups D and M, while the abundance increased in group G. The main metabolic pathways included the metabolisms of nucleotides, terpenoids, polyketides, other amino acids, cofactors, vitamins, lipids, glycan biosynthesis, energy, carbohydrates, xenobiotics, amino acids, and other secondary metabolites.
40069617	Deep cutaneous fungal infection in an immunocompetent individual caused by a biological pesticide: a rare case report.	Purpureocillium lilacinum is a type of fungus that is found all over the world and is known for its ability to help control pests, especially those that harm plants. Generally, this fungus does not cause serious problems for healthy people, but it can lead to severe infections in individuals with weakened immune systems. In this report, we discuss a rare case where a healthy person developed an infection after being exposed to a biopesticide containing this fungus.
40069476	Environmental dynamics of pesticides: sources, impacts on amphibians, nanoparticles, and endophytic microorganism remediation.	Pesticides, which are widely used in agriculture, have elicited notable environmental concern because they persist and may be toxic. The environmental dynamics of pesticides were reviewed with a focus on their sources, impacts on amphibians, and imminent remediation options. Pesticides are directly applied in ecosystems, run off into water bodies, are deposited in the atmosphere, and often accumulate in the soil and water bodies. Pesticide exposure is particularly problematic for amphibians, which are sensitive indicators of the environment's health and suffer from physiological, behavioral, and developmental disruption that has "pushed them to the brink of extinction." Finally, this review discusses the nanoparticles that can be used to tackle pesticide pollution. However, nanoparticles with large surface areas and reactivity have the potential to degrade or adsorb pesticide residues during sustainable remediation processes. Symbiotic microbes living inside plants, known as endophytic microorganisms, can detoxify pesticides. Reducing pesticide bioavailability improves plant resilience by increasing the number of metabolizing microorganisms. Synergy between nanoparticle technology and endophytic microorganisms can mitigate pesticide contamination. Results show that Interdisciplinary research is necessary to improve the application of these strategies to minimize the ecological risk of pesticides. Eco-friendly remediation techniques that promote sustainable agricultural practices, while protecting amphibian populations and ecosystem health, have advanced our understanding of pesticide dynamics.
40069475	Monitoring and risk assessment for pesticide residues in vegetables, soil, and water in Haryana, India.	The present study was conducted with the aim to identify estimates and risk assessment for the pesticide residue present in vegetables, soil, and water in Haryana, India. In the present study, environmental monitoring of commonly sprayed 161 pesticides was done using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for 102 vegetables, 46 soil, and 50 water samples collected from four districts in Haryana, India. A total of 198 samples were analyzed for the presence of pesticide residue and the measured pesticide concentrations were compared with the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) set by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and European regulations. The pesticide residues were detected in 31 vegetable samples (30.39%), 44 soil samples (95.65%), and 34 water samples (68.0%). Chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, pendimethalin, and butachlor were the most frequently detected pesticides. The health risk indices (HRI) for triazophos and chlorpyrifos pesticides in vegetable samples ranged from 1.16 to 2.76 mg/kg that can cause significant health concerns. The present study can provide valuable insights and awareness for policymakers, authorities, farmers, and consumers.
40069275	Enhancing wheat growth under chromium toxicity using gibberellic acid and microbial inoculants as modulating agents.	Chromium (Cr) is a highly toxic heavy metal that can negatively impact crop yield and food quality by causing chlorosis and reduced root and shoot growth. To address this issue, rhizobacteria has emerged as a viable and safe technology. Additionally, gibberellins (GA3) can act as allied factors for regulating various physiological processes in plants, particularly cell division and elongation under Cr stress. That's why the current study aimed to investigate the individual and combined effects of gibberellic acid (GA3) application and biofertilizer (Agrobacterium fabrum) in alleviating chromium toxicity in wheat. The treatments included two concentrations of chromium (Cr): 300Cr (300 mg Cr/kg soil) and 600Cr (600 mg Cr/kg soil), as well as the application of gibberellic acid (GA3 = 5 mg/L solution) with and without biofertilizer, i.e., A. fabrum. Results showed that the addition of GA3 + A. fabrum showed a significant increase in shoot fresh weight (~ 13%), shoot dry weight (~ 90%), root fresh weight (~ 76%), root dry weight (~ 88%), root length (~ 39%), shoot length (~ 18%) over control (no GA3 and No A. fabrum). In conclusion, GA3 + A. Farum is a better treatment for mitigating Cr toxicity in soil. More investigations are suggested at field levels under different cereal crops to declare GA3 + A. fabrum as the best treatment for alleviating Cr adverse effects on crops. Future research should focus on field-level investigations across cereal crops to validate GA3 + A. fabrum as the best treatment for alleviating Cr adverse effects on different crops and exploring its potential for integration into sustainable agricultural practices.
40069182	Glyphosate is a transformation product of a widely used aminopolyphosphonate complexing agent.	Diethylenetriamine penta(methylenephosphonate) (DTPMP) and related aminopolyphosphonates (APPs) are widely used as chelating agents in household and industrial applications. Recent studies have linked APP emissions to elevated levels of the herbicide glyphosate in European surface waters. However, the transformation processes and products of APPs in the environment are largely unknown. We show that glyphosate is formed from DTPMP by reaction with manganese at near neutral pH in pure water and in wastewater. Dissolved Mn<sup>2+</sup> and O<sub>2</sub> or suspended MnO<sub>2</sub> lead to the formation of glyphosate, which remains stable after complete DTPMP conversion. Glyphosate yields vary with the reaction conditions and reach up to 0.42 mol%. The ubiquitous presence of manganese in natural waters and wastewater systems underscores the potential importance of Mn-driven DTPMP transformation as a previously overlooked source of glyphosate in aquatic systems. These findings challenge the current paradigm of herbicide application as the sole source of glyphosate contamination and necessitate a reevaluation of water resource protection strategies.
40068964	Identification and functional characterization of silk fibroin genes in leaf-folding behaviour, silk properties and development of the rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (lepidoptera: Pyralidae).	Outbreaks of the rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) poses a significant threat to rice production. Silk-spinning creates an enclosed leaf roll that protects larvae from predators and insecticides, while serving as a feeding site and facilitating host transfer and leaf-folding. Disrupting this behaviour could enhance control strategies. The silk fibroin gene, essential for silk production, remains poorly understood in C. medinalis.
40068926	Evaluating the impact of two next-generation long-lasting insecticidal nets on malaria incidence in Uganda: an interrupted time-series analysis using routine health facility data.	Malaria remains a significant public health challenge globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where progress has stalled in recent years. Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a critical preventive tool against malaria. This study investigated the effectiveness of newer-generation LLINs following a universal coverage campaign in Uganda.
40068744	Antifungal and controlled release properties of hymexazol-chitosan-graphene oxide composite.	Pesticide carrier systems possess various advantages such as prolonged storage, lowered toxicity, and reduced environmental pollution of pesticides. Controlled release of pesticides from carriers can enhance the durability of the pesticide effect, reduce the pesticide application frequency and environmental pollution, and promote sustainable agricultural development, which represents a significant direction for the advancement of modern agriculture. Chitosan-graphene oxide (GO-CS) has been demonstrated as a promising carrier of drugs, but its application in pesticide delivery in agriculture remains largely unexplored. In this work, we synthesized a hymexazol-chitosan-graphene oxide composite (HGC) and investigated its release behavior at various temperature and pH levels to examine its antifungal activities. HGC was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In the antifungal experiment, the best GO-CS to hymexazol (HYM) ratio was determined to be 3: 7. Antifungal tests demonstrated remarkable antifungal properties of HGC. In the sustained-release experiment, HGC demonstrated a loading efficiency of 51.64 % for HYM. Sustained-release experiments revealed that the maximum sustained release occurred at 45 °C, with a release rate of 56.78 %. Hence, GO-CS emerges as a promising carrier for pesticides, and can be used to reduce both pesticide use and environmental pollution, providing significant implications for pest control in agricultural practices.
40068150	Integrated gut microbiota and serum metabolomics reveal glyphosate-induced hepatic injury in mice.	IntroductionGlyphosate (GLP) is one of the most widely used herbicides in the world. However, its underlying effects on the liver remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the toxic effects and the gut microbiome- and serum metabolite-related mechanisms of GLP on the liver in mice.Methods16S rDNA sequencing and UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS were used to investigate the mechanisms of GLP toxicity in mice administered with 0, 50, 250 and 500 mg/kg/day GLP for 30 days.ResultsGLP induced hepatocyte edema and ballooning as well as inflammatory cell infiltration. Exposure to GLP resulted in increased levels of serum ALT, TBIL, DBIL, and GLU. Microbiota analysis at the phylum level demonstrated that the proportions of Patescibacteria decreased in the GLP-treated group. The genus-level analysis identified 11 different genera, with eight decreased and three increased in the GLP-exposed group. Metabolomics analysis of serum showed 42 differential metabolites between the GLP and control groups. The metabolic pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and pyrimidine metabolism were significantly activated. Spearman analysis showed that the changes in the differential metabolites of the PPP and pyrimidine metabolism and gut microbiota were strongly associated with the biochemical index.DiscussionIn conclusion, GLP exposure induces hepatic injury through alterations in the gut microbiome and metabolic pathways, particularly by activating the pentose phosphate pathway and pyrimidine metabolism.
40068121	Visual Detection of Chlorpyrifos by DNA Hydrogel-Based Self-Actuated Capillary Aptasensor Using Nicking Enzyme-Mediated Amplification.	The abuse of chlorpyrifos (CPF), an organophosphorus pesticide, poses significant health risks to humans. Therefore, rapid and accurate detection of residual CPF is crucial to human health due to its high risk in trace amounts. Herein, we developed a simple aptasensor that combines a DNA hydrogel-based self-driven capillary with nicking enzyme-mediated amplification (NEMA), in which the NEMA is triggered through the interaction of the aptamer with CPF, and then amplified to produce a large number of single-stranded DNA that can destroy the three-dimensional structure of the DNA hydrogel. Due to the different degrees of collapse of the hydrogel membrane structure, different amounts of liquid are adsorbed into the capillary under the action of surface tension, thus realizing the naked eye detection of CPF. Under optimal conditions, the DNA hydrogel-based self-actuated capillary aptasensor can sensitively detect chlorpyrifos in the concentration range of 1 ng/L to 1 mg/L, with a detection limit of 1.73 pg/L. The advantages of the aptasensor are simple conditions, high sensitivity, and a large detection concentration range, and only a thermostat and simple operation are needed to achieve its excellent analytical performance. In addition, the developed self-actuated capillary aptasensor was successfully applied for the determination of CPF in apple, grape, cabbage, and peanut kernel.
40067882	TargetSeeker-MS: A Bayesian Inference Approach for Drug-Target Discovery Using Protein Fractionation Coupled to Mass Spectrometry.	To understand the mechanism of action of a drug and assess its clinical usefulness and viability, it is imperative that its affinity for its putative targets is determined. When coupled to mass spectrometry (MS), energetics-based protein separation (EBPS) techniques, such as a thermal shift assay, have shown great potential to identify the targets of a drug on a proteome scale. Nevertheless, the computational analyses assessing the confidence of drug-target predictions made by these methods have remained tightly tied to the protocol under which the data were produced. To identify drug targets in data sets produced using different EBPS-MS techniques, we have developed a novel flexible Bayesian inference approach named TargetSeeker-MS. We showed that TargetSeeker-MS identifies known and novel drug targets in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and HEK 293 samples treated with the fungicide benomyl. We also demonstrated that TargetSeeker-MS' drug-target identifications are reproducible in <i>C. elegans</i> samples that were processed using two different EBPS techniques (thermal shift assay and a differential precipitation of proteins, named DiffPOP). In addition, we validated a novel benomyl target by measuring its altered enzymatic activity upon drug treatment in vitro. TargetSeeker-MS, which is available as a web server (https://targetseeker.scripps.edu/), allows for the rapid, versatile, and confident identification of targets of a drug on a proteome scale, thereby providing a better understanding of its mechanisms and facilitating the evaluation of its clinical viability.
40067326	Function of Cytochrome P450 CYP72A1182 in Metabolic Herbicide Resistance Evolution in Amaranthus palmeri Populations.	Evolution of metabolic herbicide resistance is a major issue for weed management. Few genes and regulatory mechanisms have been identified, particularly in dicotyledonous weed species. We identified putative causal genes and regulatory mechanism for tembotrione-resistance in Amaranthus palmeri. Cytochrome P450 candidate genes were identified through RNA-seq analysis. We validated their functions using heterologous expression in S. cerevisae. Promoters of the candidate P450 genes were analyzed. We performed QTL mapping to identify genomic regions associated with resistance. CYP72A1182 metabolized tembotrione in heterologous system. This gene had increased expression in other A. palmeri populations resistant to multiple herbicides, including tembotrione. Resistant plants exhibited polymorphisms in the promoter of CYP72A1182. We identified QTLs linked to herbicide resistance, including one on chromosome 4 approximately 3 Mb away from CYP72A1182. CYP72A1182 is likely involved in tembotrione resistance in A. palmeri. Increased expression of this gene could be due to cis-regulation in the promoter, as well as trans-regulation from transcription factors. Further studies are in progress to test this hypothesis. The elucidation of regulatory genes is crucial for developing innovative weed management approaches and target-based novel herbicide molecules.
40067271	Resistance development to procymidone and boscalid in <i>Alternaria alternata</i> causing black spot disease on <i>Fritillaria thunbergii</i>.	Fritillaria thunbergii is a valuable medicinal plant threatened by black spot disease caused by Alternaria alternata for which application of fungicides is the primary strategy. However, the detection and characterization of fungicide resistance status in F. thunbergii has not yet been reported. A total of 106 and 128 single spore isolates of A. alternata were recovered in 2015 and 2021, respectively, from 52 and 56 F. thunbergii fields located in Jinhua, Wenzhou, Hangzhou, and Ningbo, where 90% of F. thunbergii is produced. In 2015, moderate resistance to procymidone (Pro<sup>MR</sup>), a dicarboximide fungicide that has been applied for more than 10 years, was detected at a rate of 23.6%, and the resistance frequency increased to as high as 44.5% in 2021. For the SDHI boscalid, the EC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from 0.013 to 0.976 μg/mL, with the baseline EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.57 ± 0.29 μg/mL in 2015, while the sensitivity profile showed prominent characteristics of a disruptive distribution, with a resistance frequency of 22.6% in 2022. Positive cross-resistance was observed between procymidone and iprodione (ρ = 0.897, P = 0.000), boscalid, and pydiflumetofen (ρ = 0.937, P = 0.000). No fitness penalty in growth, sporulation, germination, or pathogenicity was found for the Pro<sup>MR</sup> or the boscalid-resistant (Bos<sup>R</sup>) isolates. P894L of Os-1 was observed in all the tested Pro<sup>MR</sup> isolates, and the double point mutation (P894L + S1277L) was detected in 33.3% of Pro<sup>MR</sup> isolates. Four types of mutations in Sdh (G14W in Sdh B, V181G in Sdh D, A47T in Sdh D, and G14W in Sdh B + A47T in Sdh D) were found in the Bos<sup>R</sup> isolates.
40067159	Chiral Drug Resolution Nanochannels Inspired by Mitochondrial Membranes.	Fungicides have been widely used in agricultural production; however, their extensive use has caused serious environmental pollution. Because of its high efficiency, low toxicity, and high selectivity, chiral fungicides can effectively reduce the amount of fungicides and increase the efficiency. Hence, how to efficiently separate the enantiomers of chiral drugs with different structures is of significant research value. The multispecific recognition and selective control of the mitochondrial membrane during the transfer of substances allow us to isolate and enrich monochiral pesticide enantiomers. In this study, based on the conical nanochannel modification by <i>L</i>-alanine pillar[5]arene, combined with the "synergistic effect of double-layer membrane channel" of the mitochondrial membrane in living organisms, three different modes of double-layer serial biomimetic nanochannels were constructed. At the same time, the effect of three different modes of the tandem double nanochannel on hand selectivity is investigated. The results demonstrate that the SOD-In double nanochannels exhibit the optimal separation performance. In the experiment, using current as the detection signal, the selectivity ratio of <i>R</i>-propranolol/<i>S</i>-propranolol was determined to be 43.67. The transmembrane transport selectivity coefficient α<sub>(<i>R</i>-/<i>S</i>-PPL)</sub> was 13.19 in the single molecule transmission experiment. This study provides an effective method for highly selective enrichment of single configuration chiral pesticides, promoting green agriculture development.
40066977	Direct and Volatile Potential Applications of Essential Oils for Post-Harvest Fungi Control.	Around one third of food production is lost globally, significantly impacting food security, primarily due to post-harvest deterioration from phytopathogenic fungi. This study aimed to assess the antifungal properties of essential oils (EOs) from Syzygium aromaticum, Origanum vulgare L., Cymbopogon martini, Cymbopogon citratus, Mentha spicata, and Mentha piperita against three fungi affecting tropical fruits: Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Alternaria alternata, and Fusarium solani. The antifungal efficacy was evaluated using direct contact and volatilization methods, determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed to completely inhibit fungal growth. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to observe the effects of EOs on fungal cells. Among the tested oils, O. vulgare showed the most promise, with MIC values ranging from 40 to 200 µL/L for volatile exposure and 125 to 500 µL/L for direct contact. The results indicated that vapor exposure was more effective, requiring lower concentrations for fungal control. Thus, these EOs, particularly that of O. vulgare, present a viable alternative to synthetic fungicides for managing post-harvest fungal infections in tropical fruits, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
40066939	Preparation of a Fluxapyroxad Nanoformulation with Strong Plant Uptake for Efficient Control of <i>Verticillium</i> Wilt in Potato.	Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i> L.) is ranked as the fourth largest staple crop in China. However, potato production is increasingly threatened by <i>Verticillium</i> wilt (VW) caused by the fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> in various provinces. In the present study, we explored the application of star polycation (SPc) nanocarrier to improve the effectiveness of the fungicide fluxapyroxad (Flu) in combating VW. The SPc self-assembled with Flu through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces to form the Flu/SPc complex spontaneously, which exhibited strong intermolecular interactions, as indicated by a high affinity constant and favorable thermodynamic parameters. Complexation with SPc decreased the particle size of Flu. The Flu/SPc complex had a greater effect on <i>V. dahliae</i> than Flu alone, reducing the colony diameter and spore numbers more effectively. Expression levels of multiple key genes involved in nitrogen, polysaccharide, and sugar metabolism were downregulated in <i>V. dahliae</i> upon Flu/SPc complex treatment compared to Flu treatment, which might contribute to the greater growth inhibition in Flu/SPc-treated samples. Uptake studies in potato plants demonstrated that SPc significantly enhanced the absorption of Flu compared with Flu alone. Slighter disease symptoms and lower fungal biomass in greenhouse and field trials confirmed the enhanced protective effects of the Flu/SPc complex on potato seedlings. This is the first report that a self-assembled nanofungicide limits <i>V. dahliae</i> growth and protects potatoes from destructive VW.
40066832	Crystal Structure of Autophagy-Associated Protein 8 at 1.36 Å Resolution and Its Inhibitory Interactions with Indole Analogs.	Autophagy-associated protein 8 (ATG8) is essential for autophagy and organismal growth and development. In this study, we successfully resolved the crystal structure of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> (<i>D. melanogaster</i>) ATG8a (<i>Dm</i>ATG8a) at 1.36 Å resolution. Being distinct from previously characterized ATG8 homologues, <i>Dm</i>ATG8a (121 residues) adopts a unique fold comprising five α-helices and four β-folding strands, in contrast to the canonical four α-helices and four β-folding strands observed in other ATG8 proteins. <i>Dm</i>ATG8a features two active cavities: hydrophobic pocket 1 (HP1) and hydrophobic pocket 2 (HP2), which are essential for the normal physiological function of ATG8. Indole and its analogs can bind specifically with HP1. Microscale thermophoresis results demonstrated a strong affinity of 6-fluoroindole with <i>Dm</i>ATG8a (3.54 μmol/L), but no affinity with the <i>Dm</i>ATG8a<sup>K48A</sup> mutant, suggesting that Lys48 is critical in binding 6-fluoroindole probably via a hydrogen bond interaction. The half-maximum lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) of 6-fluoroindole against <i>D. melanogaster</i> adult flies was 169 μg/mL. Our findings establish <i>Dm</i>ATG8a as a promising target for developing indole-based insecticides.
40066760	Virulence and biocontrol potential of entomopathogenic nematodes against soil-dwelling stages of the small hive beetle under laboratory and semi-field conditions.	The small hive beetle (SHB; Aethina tumida) is a significant pest affecting honey bees and the global beekeeping industry. The harmful effects of chemical pesticides on bee health, non-target species and ecosystems highlight the need for sustainable SHB control methods. Soil applications of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) targeting the soil-dwelling life stages (wandering larvae, pupae and emerging adults) of SHB present a promising biological control approach. We conducted comprehensive laboratory experiments to evaluate the biocontrol potential of 32 Australian isolates of five EPN species (Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Heterorhabditis indica, Heterorhabditis zealandica, Steinernema carpocapsae and Steinernema feltiae) against SHB. We also performed a glasshouse experiment testing the efficacy of nine EPN isolates in soil mesocosms that simulated field conditions.
40066716	m-Aminophenylacetylene shortened the eggsac-carrying stages in the wolf spider through enhancing the synthesis of prostaglandins.	Spiders are important predatory enemies that control a range of insect pests in the rice ecosystem. m-Aminophenylacetylene (m-A) has been demonstrated to induce maternal care behaviors in Pardosa pseudoannulata, protecting young spiders and promoting population growth. Here the roles of m-A on other reproduction stages were evaluated by injecting m-A into virgin and postreproductive female spiders. When injected into virgin females, m-A can prolong the first pulli-carrying stage of the females after mating and breeding offsprings. In postreproductive females, m-A injection shortened the eggsac-carrying stages, especially in the second and third stages. Transcriptomic analysis showed that differentially expressed genes between the control female and m-A-injected female were enriched in the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism pathway. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed the upregulation of cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II), prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PGES2), and prostaglandin E synthase 3 (PGES3) genes involved in PGE<sub>2</sub> (prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>) synthesis. In a reverse validation experiment, the sequential injection of m-A followed by a COX inhibitor aspirin restored the shortened eggsac-carrying stage to normal level. The findings indicated that m-A enhanced PGs synthesis, leading to a reduced eggsac-carrying stage. The eggsac-carrying stage can be fatal when female spiders encounter their enemies, so the shortening of the stage by m-A would reduce the potential threat. These findings are significant for developing environmentally friendly control strategies.
40066485	Highly Stable, Excellent Foliar Adhesion and Anti-Photodegradation Nucleic Acid-Peptide Coacervates for Broad Agrochemicals Delivery.	Agrochemicals play a pivotal role in the management of pests and diseases and the way agrochemicals are utilized exerts significant impacts on the environment. Ensuring rational application and improving utilization rates of agrochemicals are major demands in developing green delivery systems. Herein, a model of nucleic acid-peptide coacervate (NPC) for agrochemical delivery is presented, which is formed by mixing negatively charged single-stranded DNAs with positively charged poly-L-lysine. The NPC microsystem exhibits broad loading capacities for various types of agrochemicals. Furthermore, the NPCs demonstrate remarkable protection against photodegradation for photosensitive agrochemicals. In the foliar interactions, the NPCs exhibit excellent wetting performances and foliar adhesion on hydrophobic cabbage leaves and wheat leaves infected with powdery mildew to facilitate direct spaying in practical applications. Subsequently, the NPC microsystem is stabilized against coalescence by a charged comb polymer. Then, the NPC loaded with emamectin benzoates (EBs) exhibited significantly higher insecticidal activity compared to free EBs. This enhanced efficacy can be attributed to the higher insect uptake efficiency of the NPC formulation, as evidenced by fluorescent imaging of mosquito larvae. This coacervate model provides a new biocompatible and highly efficient system for future agrochemical delivery that actively contributes to eco-friendly and sustainable agriculture.
40066208	Assessment of fall-back MRLs for revoked CXLs previously implemented in the EU legislation.	In the 55th meeting of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR meeting) held in June 2024 and the subsequent 47th meeting of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) (November 2024), in total 111 Codex MRLs (CXLs) for 16 active substances (a.s.) were revoked. In accordance with Article 43 of Regulation (EC) 396/2005, EFSA was requested by the European Commission to identify the revoked CXLs which had been previously taken over in the EU MRL legislation (Regulation (EC) No 396/2005) and, if possible, propose fall-back maximum residue levels (MRLs) to replace the revoked CXLs. Based on the detailed assessment and taking into account the information provided by Member States, EFSA proposed fall-back MRLs for carbofuran in cotton seed and fluopyram/wheat. Risk management discussions are recommended to decide on the appropriate fall-back option for cyantraniliprole in soya beans. For difenoconazole, EFSA proposed to postpone the decision on a possible fall-back MRL, pending the outcome of the ongoing review of EU MRLs. For imazapyr/wheat and cyantraniliprole/beans and eggs, the existing MRLs will be replaced by new CXLs. The revocation of the other CXLs does not trigger a modification of the existing EU MRLs.
40066046	Antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of alpha-silver tungstate nanoparticles.	The growing global threat posed by microorganisms resistant to conventional antimicrobials underscores the urgent need for novel agents to control infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of alpha-silver tungstate (α-Ag<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by the ultrasonic method. The NPs were characterized, and their antimicrobial activity was assessed against <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> using the broth microdilution method, determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was detected by fluorescence using the CM-H₂DCFDA probe. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using murine L929 fibroblasts by MTT assay. Cell viability of both microorganisms and L929 fibroblasts was further assessed using Confocal Laser Scanning Fluorescence Microscopy (CLSM). For <i>C. albicans</i>, the MIC was 3.90 μg/mL, and the MFC was 7.81 μg/mL. For <i>S. aureus</i>, the MIC and MBC were both 62.50 μg/mL, while <i>E. coli</i> exhibited MIC and MBC values of 0.48 μg/mL. The biocompatibility assay revealed a significant reduction in cell viability at concentrations starting from 15.62 μg/mL. CLSM images corroborated the results from both microbiological and biocompatibility assays. Additionally, ROS production was detected in all three microorganisms upon exposure to the NPs, confirming their antimicrobial mechanism. In conclusion, α-Ag₂WO₄ NPs effectively inactivated <i>C. albicans</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, and <i>E. coli</i>. However, a higher concentration was required to inhibit <i>S. aureus</i> compared to <i>E. coli</i> and <i>C. albicans</i>. The biocompatibility assay revealed concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects. These findings highlight the potential of α-Ag<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> NPs as antimicrobial agents and suggest further research into their efficacy against biofilms, optimization of their biocompatibility, and the application of these nanomaterials in the incorporation and coating of materials used in biomedical and dental devices.
40065631	Genome Mining and Antagonism of Stenotrophomonas geniculata MK-1, Against Peanut Foliage Fungus Diseases.	Stenotrophomonas geniculata, a bacterium, has been recognized as an eco-friendly substitute for chemical fungicides in managing peanut foliar diseases, web blotch, and early leaf spot. Core genome and pan-genome analysis identified that strain MK-1 belongs to Stenotrophomonas geniculata, and nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis confirmed that strain belongs to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The research revealed that S. geniculata MK-1 had a notable antagonistic impact on Peyronellaea arachidicola and Cercospora arachidicola and demonstrated a biocontrol efficacy of over 95% against peanut early leaf spot and web blotch disease. The nonredundant protein sequences (NR) database identified 4324 annotations related to S. geniculata, with 2682 genes similar to strain MK-1. The COG database categorized 3041 annotations into 22 functional groups, and 33 distinct metabolic pathways associated with 1851 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations. Most genes linked with metabolism are found in S. geniculata, with 380 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 44 genes related to secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database identified 194 annotations are linked to non-ribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites. The Pathogen-Host Interactions (PHI) database showed reduced virulence in strain MK-1, while unaffected pathogenicity protein counts were 52. The MK-1 strain can produce antifungal siderophores secondary metabolites, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and siderophores.
40065412	Efficacy of a novel chewable tablet (Credelio Quattro<sup>™</sup>) containing lotilaner, moxidectin, praziquantel, and pyrantel for the treatment and control of Echinococcus multilocularis and E. granulosus infections in dogs.	While generally harmless to dogs, the cestode species Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis have significant zoonotic importance, causing cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis in humans, respectively. Regular deworming is essential to treat intestinal cestode infections in dogs and to reduce environmental egg contamination and thus the subsequent zoonotic risk of infection to intermediate hosts and humans. The studies described here evaluated the efficacy of a new novel chewable tablet combination containing lotilaner, moxidectin, praziquantel and pyrantel (Credelio Quattro, Elanco Animal Health) against E. granulosus and E. multilocularis infections in dogs.
40065246	Epigallocatechin -3- gallate mitigates diazinon neurotoxicity via suppression of pro-inflammatory genes and upregulation of antioxidant pathways.	Diazinon is a commonly used organophosphate (OP) insecticide especially in developing countries for the control of insect pests, however, exposure to its toxic impact especially in humans and other non-target species remains an important public health concern. The study aimed to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin -3- gallate (EGCG), abundant in green tea plants on neurobehavioural, biochemical, and pathological changes in the brain of male Wistar rats following exposure to diazinon toxicity. Sixty adult male Wistar rats were acclimatized for seven days and subsequently randomly assigned into six treatment groups as follows: Group I: Control group (0.2 mL distilled water); Group II: Diazinon at 3 mg/kg (1% LD50); Group III: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (50 mg/kg, ~ 2% of LD50); Group IV: Diazinon (3 mg/kg) + EGCG (100 mg/kg, ~ 5% of LD50); Group V: EGCG (50 mg/kg) and Group VI: EGCG (100 mg/kg). All treatments were administered orally once daily for 14 days. Neurobehavioural studies, biomarkers of oxidative stress, histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) were performed. Diazinon alone impaired recognition memory, increased oxidative stress markers and altered antioxidant defense in the brain. It upregulated TNF-α and IL-6 genes and repressed GPx 4 gene expressions. It was also associated with increased GFAP, Tau, and α-SN immunoreactivity. Microscopic examination revealed loss of Purkinje and hippocampal cells in brain. Co-treatment with EGCG however improved cognition, lowered oxidative stress markers, improved antioxidant status and suppressed TNF-α and IL-6. In conclusion, findings from this study demonstrated that EGCG offered protection against diazinon-induced neurotoxicity. Hence, natural sources of epigallocatechin -3- gallate such as fruits and vegetables could offer immense benefits by protecting against oxidative stress and inflammation in neurodegenerative disease conditions.Clinical trial number Not applicable.
40064929	Robust Fe-N<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> single atom sites for efficient PMS activation and enhanced Fe<sup>IV</sup> = O reactivity.	The microenvironment regulation of Fe-N<sub>4</sub> single atom catalysts (SACs) critically governs peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Although conventional heteroatom substitution in primary coordination enhances activity, it disrupts Fe-N<sub>4</sub> symmetry and compromises stability. Herein, we propose oxygen doping in the secondary coordination shell to construct Fe-N<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> SAC, which amplifies the localized electric field while preserving the pristine coordination symmetry, thus trading off its activity and stability. This approach suppresses Fe-N bond structural deformation (bond amplitude reduced from 0.875-3.175 Å to 0.925-2.975 Å) during PMS activation by lowering Fe center electron density to strengthen Fe-N bond, achieving extended catalytic durability (>240 h). Simultaneously, the weakened coordination field lowers the Fe=O σ* orbital energy, promoting electrophilic σ-attack of high-valent iron-oxo towards bisphenol A, and increasing its degradation rate by 41.6-fold. This work demonstrates secondary coordination engineering as a viable strategy to resolve the activity-stability trade-off in SAC design, offering promising perspectives for developing environmental catalysts.
40064926	Assessment of organophosphate pesticides in soils and vegetables from agricultural areas of Delta Central District, Nigeria.	The application of agrochemicals such as organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) has several benefits in agriculture but also poses great risks to the environment and human well-being. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the concentrations, distribution pattern, relationships, potential risks and sources of OPPs in agricultural soils and vegetables from Delta Central District (DCD) of Nigeria to provide useful information for pollution history, establishment of pollution control measures and risk management. Fourteen OPPs were determined in the soil and vegetables using a gas chromatograph-mass selective detector (GC-MSD). The ∑14 OPPs concentrations varied from 5.29 to 419 ng g<sup>-1</sup> for soil and 0.69 to 130 ng g<sup>-1</sup> for vegetables. On average, pirimiphos methyl (23.8 ng g<sup>-1</sup>) and diazinone (4.74 ng g<sup>-1</sup>) were the dominant OPPs in soils and vegetables respectively. The cumulative ecological risk assessed using the toxicity-exposure-ratio (TER) and risk quotient (RQ) approaches revealed that there was a high risk of OPPs to soil organisms. The increasing order of OPPs toxicity to the soil organisms was chlorpyriphos < fenitrothion < diazinone < pirimiphos methyl while the cumulative human health risk suggested there was adverse non-carcinogenic risk for children but not for adults exposed to OPPs in these agricultural soils and vegetables.
40064833	Advances in biosynthesis of chiral amide herbicides and the key enzymes: dimethenamid-P and S-metolachlor as case studies.	Chiral amide herbicides represent a significant class of agrochemicals, widely used for effective weed control. Prominent examples include S-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P, both of which share the intermediate (S)-1-methoxy-2-propylamine, a key structural component in their synthesis. Developing green and sustainable methods for producing this intermediate is crucial for enhancing the environmental and economic feasibility of herbicide manufacturing. Biosynthesis, with its advantages in sustainability and efficiency, has emerged as a pivotal approach in pesticide production. This review explores the classification and current development status of chiral amide herbicides, including their varieties and applications in the agricultural market. It outlines the synthesis pathways for S-metolachlor and dimethenamid-P, covering both chemical and biosynthetic routes. The review also highlights the functional properties of the key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of (S)-1-methoxy-2-propylamine, focusing on the potential for enzyme engineering and creation to optimize these pathways. The challenges and future development directions for amide herbicides are discussed, with an emphasis on overcoming synthetic and ecological barriers.
40064749	Far-red light-driven photoautotrophy of chlorophyll f-producing cyanobacterium without red-shifted phycobilisome core complex.	Chlorophyll (Chl) f production expands oxygenic photosynthesis of some cyanobacteria into the far-red light (FRL) region through reconstructed FRL-allophycocyanin (APC) cores and Chl f-containing photosystems. Presently, a unicellular cyanobacterium was isolated for studying FRL photoacclimation (FaRLiP) and classified as a new species Altericista leshanensis. It uses additional Chl f and FRL-APC cores, with retained white light (WL)-phycobiliproteins to thrive FRL conditions. Marker-less deletion of FaRLiP-apcE2 gene was constructed using CRISPR-Cpf1 system. This genetic manipulation has no significant effects on the expression of genes in the FaRLiP gene cluster, including adjacent apc genes under FRL conditions. The function-loss mutant cells cannot assemble FRL-APC cores, and show the decreased growth rate and Chl f production under FRL conditions. Interestingly, the expression levels of phycocyanin (PC) subunits (cpc) and photosystem II D1 proteins (psbA2) are significantly increased in mutant cells under FRL conditions. These results suggest that FRL acclimation in the mutant cells has a different photosynthetic apparatus due to the lack of FRL-APC cores. The alternative strategy of FaRLiP provides additional evidence of flexible pathways towards the potential application of Chl f and associated biotechnology.
40064669	Occurrence, Removal, and Ecological and Human Health Risk Assessment of 18 Endocrine Disrupting Compounds in Wastewater Treatment Plants in Nanjing, China.	This study analyzed the characteristics of 18 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) detected in four wastewater treatment plants in Nanjing, China. The removal efficiency, ecological and health risks of EDCs were evaluated. The results showed that EDCs were detected to different degrees, with prednisone as the main contributor, and the total concentrations of EDCs ranged from 532.89 to 8535.88 ng/L and 14.98 to 128.91 ng/L, respectively. Most of the EDCs were significantly decreased after secondary treatment, with removal efficiencies ranging from 9.7% to 100%. The ecological risk assessment showed that trenbolone and norethindrone had the highest risk quotients and posed a high risk to aquatic organisms. The health risk evaluation suggested that the health risk values in the cases of adult drinking water route, children's drinking water route, and adult exposure route were all less than 1, indicating that EDCs did not pose significant non-carcinogenic health hazards to humans.
40064439	Reshaped local microbiology metabolism by raw tea according to pile fermentation in the dark tea.	Traditionally, the mechanism of dark tea quality formation has centered on microorganisms, with quality regulated by manipulating microorganisms and their fermentation environment. Nevertheless, raw teas, the natural selective medium of microbial community, was completely ignored in the formation of dark tea unique flavors.
40064349	Distribution and Accumulation Dynamics of Fungicide Azoxystrobin in the Soil-Plant System.	Azoxystrobin is a widely used fungicide belonging to the strobilurin group, primarily employed to control a range of fungal diseases in crops, including pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). As a systemic pesticide, it effectively inhibits mitochondrial respiration in fungi, thereby preventing their growth and spread. However, concerns have emerged regarding its environmental persistence and potential bioaccumulation in soil-plant systems. This study conducted a field study and utilized HPLC-MS/MS for sample analysis, investigating the distribution and accumulation dynamics of azoxystrobin in the soil-plant system, with a focus on its behavior in different soil depths and plant tissues. The results show that pesticide concentration in the shoots remained consistently low throughout the observation period. In contrast, the concentration in roots gradually increased over time, with a peak observed in the top soil around the 10th day (16.56 mg/kg), followed by a rapid decrease to 1.44 mg/kg by the 14th day after application. The pesticide concentration in the subsurface soil remained relatively stable, reaching 0.91 mg/kg by the 35th day. The percentage distribution of pesticides in different parts of the system was as follows: top soil > subsurface soil > roots > shoots. The biological concentration factor (BCF) was greater than 1 during the early and middle-late growth stages, and both the biological accumulation coefficient (BAC) and translocation factor (TF) remained consistently below 1. This study highlights the role of the top soil as a primary pesticide reservoir and suggests limited translocation efficiency from roots to shoots. This pattern of accumulation could have significant implications for environmental health by indicating potential risks of pesticide persistence in the soil, emphasizing the need for further research on optimizing agricultural practices to mitigate pesticide accumulation in the environment.
40064255	Pesticide-fertilizer synergistic alginate-based hydrogel for enhanced pesticide retention and nutrient optimization against apple Valsa canker.	The prevalence of apple Valsa canker (AVC) poses a significant threat to the vitality of apple trees, jeopardizing the progress of the apple industry. Current strategies have proven inadequate in managing the disease effectively due to challenges such as extended duration and frequent relapses, especially low-adhesion vertical target. Herein, we introduce a pesticide-fertilizer synergistic alginate-based hydrogel (P&F-Gel) to enhance long-term pesticide retention and offer nutrient supplementation without labor-intensive practices. By sequentially spraying a suspension concentrate with sodium alginate (SA) as thickening agent, followed by a cross-linked fertilizer (CCF) dominated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and other nutrient, rapid in-situ gelation is achieved on the low-adhesion vertical xylem surface. P&F-Gel demonstrates strong in-situ adhesion, long-term retention, and flush resistance, with temperature-triggered pesticide release making it suitable for field applications in humid and warm climates where AVC often breaks out. Additionally, P&F-Gel exhibits superior antifungal efficacy in vitro and in orchard, due to its capacity to isolate oxygen and inhibit fungal proliferation. Overall, our P&F-Gel represents the first use of a hydrogel strategy in trunk treatment, which provided a possibility to control AVC without intensive labor and protect apple trees from recurrence for over 6 months, paving the way for modern sustainable agriculture.
40063867	Impact of mass drug administration with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole for lymphatic filariasis on hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis infections in Papua New Guinea.	Persons with lymphatic filariasis (LF) are often co-infected with soil-transmitted helminths. A single co-administered dose of ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (IDA) is recommended by WHO for mass drug administration (MDA) for LF instead of diethylcarbamazine/albendazole (DA) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). We compared the effectiveness of a single round of MDA with IDA or DA on hookworm and strongyloidiasis in PNG.
40063805	Sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to multiple <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> traits in transgenic maize.	Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.
40063644	Leishmaniasis in deployed military populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis.	Leishmaniasis affects military personnel deployed to endemic areas following exposure to sand flies infected with the protozoa Leishmania. This systematic review and meta-analysis of data specific to military populations aims to identify knowledge gaps to mitigate sand fly exposure and Leishmania transmission during deployments. The review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023463687). Random-effects meta-analyses and narrative synthesis were performed. Thirty-six studies were included, most of which reported on cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), showing a mean cumulative incidence of 10% (95% CI: 5-16), suggesting higher rates in the Eastern Mediterranean region (14% [95% CI: 12-16]) compared to the African region (8%) and American region (9%). Asymptomatic Leishmania infection had a cumulative incidence of 11% (95% CI: 6-17), with higher rates in Eastern Mediterranean countries (20% [95% CI: 14-25]). Diagnosis involved parasitological, serological, and molecular methods, with L. (L) mexicana and L. (V.) braziliensis identified as the predominant CL pathogens in deployed troops in the Americas. Visceral leishmaniasis cases were less frequent, all reported from the Eastern Mediterranean and associated with the Leishmania donovani/infantum complex; whereas CL cases in the Old World were due predominantly to L. major and L. tropica. Regular use of long-lasting insecticidal nets to mitigate sand fly exposure demonstrated high potential effectiveness than other reported personal protective measures (PPMs) which yielded mixed or inconclusive results. In summary, the systematic review revealed the substantial variability between study designs and statistical integrity. There is need for more consistent and robustly designed studies including well-define controls and replication. Future studies would be advised to explore the long-term effectiveness and practicality of PPMs, both individually and in combination, across diverse deployment settings.
40063614	Genome-wide association analysis of Septoria tritici blotch for adult plant resistance in elite bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L) genotypes.	Septoria tritici blotch (STB) is a predominant foliar disease of wheat, caused by the pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. This disease can lead to substantial yield losses warranting control by using expensive fungicides. One effective method of STB control is the utilization of resistant wheat varieties. In this particular study, a panel comprising of 186 bread wheat genotypes was assessed for their adult plant resistance (APR) to STB. Field trials were conducted across five environments in Ethiopia during the 2022 and 2023 growing seasons under natural infestation conditions. The association panel was genotyped using 20K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. To determine the relationship between genetic markers and STB resistance, a mixed linear model (MLM) analysis was performed using the statgen GWAS R software package. Heritability estimates for STB resistance ranged from 0.39 to 0.95, underscoring the genetic variability and the potential for selection. The study identified 52 marker-trait associations (MTAs) for STB resistance at maturity (SDSM) and 62 MTAs at heading (SDSH). Chromosome 5A contains a high concentration of MTAs that confer resistance to STB, hosting multiple significant MTAs, including four consistently associated markers ('Kukri_c10033_724', 'RAC875_rep_c116420_103', 'TG0019', and 'RAC875_c30566_230'). Additionally, chromosomes 1B, 2B, 5B, and 7A were found to harbor important MTAs, contributing to resistance across various environments. Notably, two QTLs, qtSTB23 (5A) and qtSTB38 (7B), exhibited stability across multiple environments, making them robust candidates for breeding programs. Furthermore, novel resistance loci on chromosome 2A were discovered, offering new opportunities for enhancing resistance. Therefore, these findings provide an opportunity for improving STB resistance through gene stacking using marker-assisted selection (MAS).
40063342	Evaluation of in vivo fish and amphibian endocrine test guideline assays: current status and future needs.	Endocrine pathways are crucial in regulating physiological functions in organisms, including growth and development, metabolism, tissue function, and reproduction. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can interfere with normal hormonal function and lead to adverse effects in organisms and/or their offspring. As a result, regulatory testing and assessment requirements have been implemented to identify and regulate EDCs-defined by the World Health Organization as chemicals that alter the function of an endocrine system and cause "subsequent adverse effects in an intact organism, its progeny, or (sub)populations" - although the approaches taken for assessment vary worldwide. As such, the current typical ecotoxicological assessment paradigm for EDCs involves initial testing for endocrine activity using in vitro and lower-tier in vivo assays, followed by higher-tier in vivo testing which can provide additional endocrine mechanistic data and establishes any consequent adversity. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, among other entities, have validated and adopted standardized in vivo test guidelines for mammals, fish, and amphibians. These tests can be challenging and take months to perform, and many require the use of large numbers of laboratory animals. This paper summarizes the current state of the science for evaluating the endocrine disrupting potential of chemicals in fish and amphibians using in vivo test guideline assays across the estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and steroidogenesis modalities. Current challenges associated with conducting and interpreting the in vivo assays are discussed. Opportunities and potential next steps to strengthen this growing area of testing are explored, including potential to inform development and application of new approach methodologies and thereby reduce reliance on using laboratory animals.
40063328	Broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of linalool: supporting its pharmacological use in chronic wound infections by pathogens within the ESKAPE group and polymicrobial biofilms.	Chronic wound infections are caused by biofilm forming opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. The persistence of infection, co-infecting pathogens and prolonged use of antibiotics promote antibiotic resistance hampering healing process due to increased inflammation. Hence, we tested the broad range antibacterial activity of linalool, a bioactive monoterpene commonly present in many essential oils having anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities to target different opportunistic pathogens commonly found in the chronic wound. We included some of the common pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, to study the broad range antimicrobial efficacy of linalool. The in vitro effect of linalool on biofilm was quantified in pre-treatment, post-treatment, repetitive treatment, and polymicrobial biofilm scenarios. Time-kill and XTT (2,3-bis [2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2 H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) assays were performed to confirm the efficacy of linalool against wound infections, and these results were further validated using simulated wound exudates medium (WEM) which mimics the wound environment. The mechanism of bactericidal action was determined using assays for membrane integrity and oxidative stress. The results indicated the broad range antimicrobial activity of linalool with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 2.5 to 5 µL/mL against E. coli, A. baumannii, E. faecalis, S. aureus, and K. pneumoniae, while for P. aeruginosa the MIC was 20 µL/mL. Linalool was most effective against E. coli, E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and S. aureus, and could inhibit the growth and biofilm by more than 90% and 80%, respectively, at 5 µL/mL. The XTT assay confirmed the MIC results, showing a significant reduction in the metabolic activity of the pathogens (p < 0.001). In the simulated WEM similar response of the bacteria to linalool treatment was observed. At 5 to 20 µL/mL concentrations, linalool significantly inhibited the polymicrobial biofilm consisting of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and S. aureus in two species combinations. The mechanism of bactericidal action was associated with the increased reactive oxygen species production and disruption in the membrane integrity leading to release of cellular content. The anti-inflammatory activity of linalool, assessed using the albumin denaturation method showed significant activity at the tested concentrations. In conclusion, the findings suggest the therapeutic potential of linalool in treating biofilm associated chronic wound infections due to its versatile broad spectrum activity.
40063176	Alleviation of glyphosate-induced toxicity by Horseradish tree (Moringa oleifera) Leaf extract and phytase in Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) highlighting the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities.	The danger posed by waterborne toxicity from herbicides endangers the aquatic ecosystem. Using dietary medicinal herbs is a useful approach to mitigate the effects of herbicide toxicity on aquatic animals. This study attempts to examine the consequences and potential mechanisms behind the dietary addition of horseradish tree (Moringa oleifera) leaf extract (MOLE) with the help of phytase addition to check the overall growth performance, biochemical changes, histological alteration, and gene expression in normal and after glyphosate challenge in Nile tilapia. A total number of 135 Nile tilapia fish (7.93 ± 0.03 g) were randomly assigned into three groups each in triplicate. The first group is the control group and fed basal diet; the second group supplied with MOLE (200 mg of extract/kg), and the third group was supplied with MOLE (200 mg /kg), and phytase (0.2g/ kg) for 8 weeks. After the feeding trial, each experimental group was divided into two subgroups to be unchallenged and challenged with glyphosate (30 mg/L of water). The results declared significant enhancements (P < 0.05) in Weight Gain Percent (WG%), Specific growth rate (SGR), and Protein efficiency ratio (PER) and reducing feed conversion ratio (FCR) with up-regulating hepatic gh, igf1,myogenine, intestinal ghrelin and NPY in fish groups fed MOLE and phytase compared with the control group. Moreover, improving the hepatic antioxidant capacity while down-regulating hepatic igf1bp, myostatin. Interstingly, MOLE and phytase lightened glyphosate-induced biochemical alterations, antioxidants, apoptosis, and inflammation-associated genes compared to the glyphosate-challenged group. Interestingly, UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis recognized 16 compounds encompasing two glucosinolates, three flavonoids, one phenolic and three alkaloids in addition to four fatty acids, a terpenoid, one phytate and an aromatic glycoside. These components might be accountable for the potential effects exerted by MOLE. Therefore, the current study suggests that dietary supplementation to MOLE and phytase can be used as substitute feed supplements in sustainable farming of Nile tilapia to defend against glyphosate challenges and enhance growth, antioxidant capacity, exerting anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects under normal health conditions or post glyphosate challenge.
40062997	Polyoxometalates for the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxide and its derivatives: from novel structures to functional applications.	Nitrogen oxide and its derivatives, including nitroaromatic hydrocarbons and various other nitro compounds, are commonly used in industrial applications such as synthesizing drugs, dyes, pesticides, and explosives. However, these compounds are also highly toxic to the environment. Their long-term accumulation can significantly affect air and water quality and disrupt ecosystems. Thus, efficiently converting these harmful compounds into more valuable products through catalytic processes is an urgent challenge in chemical catalysis. In this regard, polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as promising inorganic molecular catalysts for the reduction of nitrogen oxide and its derivatives. Their unique structure, excellent redox properties, and versatile catalytic abilities contribute to their effectiveness. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in the POM-catalyzed reduction of nitrogen oxide and its derivatives, focusing on reducing nitroaromatic hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. Additionally, we discuss the reaction mechanisms involved in the catalytic process, explore the potential of POMs' structural features for the rational design and optimization of catalytic performance, and highlight future directions for developing POM-based catalysts.
40062965	Toxicokinetics for organ-on-chip devices.	Organ-on-chip (OOC) devices are an emerging New Approach Method in both pharmacology and toxicology. Such devices use heterotypic combinations of human cells in a micro-fabricated device to mimic <i>in vivo</i> conditions and better predict organ-specific toxicological responses in humans. One drawback of these devices is that they are often made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a polymer known to interact with hydrophobic chemicals. Due to this interaction, the actual dose experienced by cells inside OOC devices can differ strongly from the nominal dose. To account for these effects, we have developed a comprehensive model to characterize chemical-PDMS interactions, including partitioning into and diffusion through PDMS. We use these methods to characterize PDMS interactions for 24 chemicals, ranging from fluorescent dyes to persistent organic pollutants to organophosphate pesticides. We further show that these methods return physical interaction parameters that can be used to accurately predict time-dependent doses under continuous-flow conditions, as would be present in an OOC device. These results demonstrate the validity of the methods and model across geometries and flow rates.
40062941	A systematic review of the relation between ten potential occupational sensitizing exposures and asthma.	The aim of this systematic review was to identify, evaluate, and synthesize the relation between ten potential occupational sensitizing exposure groups and asthma.
40062902	Development of Metal-Organic Framework-Based Emamectin Benzoate Nanopesticides for Effective Control of <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>.	Pine wilt disease is caused by <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i> invasion and has a great impact on global pine resources. Injection of emamectin benzoate (EB) into pine trunks is an effective way to control <i>B. xylophilus</i>. However, EB has limited aqueous solubility, easily photodissociates, and its long-term use causes resistance problems. In this study, the metal-organic framework material ZIF-8 was prepared, and EB was loaded onto ZIF-8 through physical adsorption, resulting in a pH-responsive EB@ZIF-8 nanopesticide with a high drug loading rate (36.04%). Simulated release experiments of EB@ZIF-8 under different pH conditions showed a cumulative release of 64.43% within 10 h at pH 5.0, which increased as the pH decreased, compared to conditions at pH 7.0 and 9.0. EB@ZIF-8 showed positive insecticidal activity in a laboratory biological test (LC<sub>50</sub> = 52.503 mg/L). In addition, 7 days after trunk injection in <i>Pinus massoniana</i>, EB residuals were detected in all parts of the branches, with the lowest residue level being 73.39 mg/kg. The proportion of the EB residue in the lower, middle, and upper branches of <i>P. massoniana</i> gradually increased, reaching 43.92% at 28 days after trunk injection, indicating that EB was distributed evenly in the tree. Therefore, EB@ZIF-8 had good morphology, structure, and pH-responsive release performance. EB@ZIF-8 also exhibited a high nematocidal ability due to its smaller particle size and rapid transport in <i>P. massoniana</i>. This study provides a new approach for the development of highly effective EB preparations, improvement of pesticide utilization, and <i>B. xylophilus</i> control.
40062488	Sensitivity to Boscalid and Trifloxystrobin and Fitness of <i>Corynespora cassiicola</i> Associated with <i>CcSdh</i> & <i>CcCytb</i> in Cucumber.	The extensive use of succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) and quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) has led to the development of resistance in <i>Corynespora cassiicola</i>, which causes corynespora leaf spot (CLS) in cucumber. In this study, the sensitivity and the resistance phenotypes to SDHIs and QoIs were monitored, and the fitness of <i>C. cassiicola</i> carrying <i>CcSdh</i> & <i>CcCytb</i> mutations was measured. The average 50% effective suppressive concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values of <i>C. cassiicola</i> to boscalid from 2019 to 2021 ranged from 6.65 to 24.16 μg/mL, while the average EC<sub>50</sub> values of <i>C. cassiicola</i> to trifloxystrobin from 2007 to 2021 ranged from 105.11 to 462.02 μg/mL. Ten fungicide resistance phenotypes and 19 resistance genotypes were found. The D-D95E&Cytb-G143A and B-H278L&Cytb-G143A mutants presented increased fitness, while the B-H278Y&Cytb-G143A mutant showed significant fitness costs, and the other mutants presented no or slight fitness costs. These findings provide a basis for the formulation of resistance management strategies of CLS.
40062477	Molecular Insights into Pharmacological Mechanism of Insect Kir Channels and the Toxicity of Kir Inhibitors on Hemipteran Insects.	Inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir) play a key role in regulating various physiological processes. However, the structural and pharmacological mechanisms of insect Kir channels remain unclear. In this study, we show that coexpression of different Kir subunits in the same tissue did not affect the rectification properties of strongly rectifying Kir. The Kir inhibitor VU041, along with the insecticide flonicamid and its metabolite flumetnicam, were tested for their inhibitory effects on the homotetrameric Kir1 and Kir2 channels. Both Kir1 and Kir2 channels from the two insect species showed similar pharmacological responses to VU041, flonicamid, and flumetnicam. However, VU041 demonstrated significantly higher inhibitory activity than both insecticides across all four Kir channels, while flumetnicam exhibited the weakest inhibition. Molecular docking analyses indicate that the binding site of VU041 is not the same as that of flonicamid, and flumetnicam. flonicamid, and flumetnicam have binding sites similar to the ATP binding sites in cytoplasmic region of human Kir6.2, whereas VU041 is located in the pore of the ion channel, and serves as a pore blocker that inhibits Kir channels. Mutation analysis confirmed the essential roles of these residues in channel function and binding affinity. Finally, the toxicities of the three inhibitors were evaluated in <i>N. lugens</i> and <i>M. persicae</i>. VU041, a potent inhibitor of the insect Kir channel, showed lower toxicity compared to the other two inhibitors, whereas flumethoxan, which is less active on the Kir1 channel, showed higher toxicity, probably related to the different bioavailability of the different compounds. These findings suggest that the potential of targeting Kir channels as insecticidal strategies requires further evaluation.
40062248	A systematic review of deep learning techniques for apple leaf diseases classification and detection.	Agriculture sustains populations and provides livelihoods, contributing to socioeconomic growth. Apples are one of the most popular fruits and contains various antioxidants that reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Additionally, they are low in calories, making them a healthy snack option for all ages. However, several factors can adversely affect apple production. These issues include diseases that drastically lower yield and quality and cause farmers to lose millions of dollars. To minimize yield loss and economic effects, it is essential to diagnose apple leaf diseases accurately and promptly. This allows targeted pesticide and insecticide use. However, farmers find it difficult to distinguish between different apple leaf diseases since their symptoms are quite similar. Computer vision applications have become an effective tool in recent years for handling these issues. They can provide accurate disease detection and classification through massive image datasets. This research analyzes and evaluates datasets, deep learning methods and frameworks built for apple leaf disease detection and classification. A systematic analysis of 45 articles published between 2016 and 2024 was conducted to evaluate the latest developments, approaches, and research needs in this area.
40062144	From Nature to Emergency: Cardiac Complications Following the Consumption of Unwashed Fruit.	<i>Ziziphus spina-Christi</i> (Sidr) is widely used for its medicinal and nutritional properties, with documented pharmacological effects such as antidiabetic, sedative, and antihypertensive activities. However, its consumption, especially in unregulated settings, can pose significant health risks due to potential toxicity and contamination with pesticides. We report the case of a 25-year-old male who presented with severe abdominal pain radiating to the chest, profound bradycardia (heart rate in the 20s), hypotension (systolic blood pressure in the 50s), and autonomic symptoms after ingesting unwashed <i>Z. spina-Christi</i> fruit. Initial investigations revealed Mobitz type I second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, transient ST depression, and elevated troponin levels, raising suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, comprehensive cardiac evaluations, including CT coronary angiography and cardiac MRI, excluded ischemic and structural cardiac causes. A detailed history revealed the ingestion of unwashed fruit, suggesting toxicity exacerbated by pesticide exposure. The patient responded well to supportive care, including atropine, and was discharged on the fourth day with a complete resolution of symptoms. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge posed by toxic ingestions mimicking ACS. Although it is not clear if <i>Z. spina-Christi</i> induced cardiotoxic effects at higher doses, the pesticide contamination could have also contributed to cardiotoxicity. Clinicians should consider toxicological etiologies in patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms, especially when linked to potential exposures. Early recognition and prompt management are critical for favorable outcomes.
40060804	A Comparative Analysis of Cockroach and Mosquito, Octopamine Receptor Homologues Produced Using Chimera, Swiss-Model, and AlphaFold Molecular Modeling Tools.	Homology modeling can help bridge the gap between missing 3D structures and available primary sequences of protein. More environmentally friendlier insecticides against domestic nuisance can target the octopamine receptor proteins, only expressed in invertebrates. Herein, octopamine receptor homologues from <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, which do not have tertiary structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), were built using homology modeling and evaluated with various molecular modeling tools. AlphaFold models (AFM), which use artificial intelligence from DeepMind, showed structural validity when superimposed on Swiss-Model models (SMM) for both insect octopamine receptor species. The UCSF Chimera and Modeler models (CMM) did not match those by AlphaFold and Swiss-Model irrespective of the insect species receptor model compared. The greatest discrepancy between any two structures resulted between AFM and CMM with only 21.46% similarity and 14.92% similarity between backbone αCs of their superimposed 3D structures, respectively, for cockroach and mosquito, yet their primary sequences are highly identical. The highest sequence identity for superimposed 3D structures occurred between AFM and SMM of cockroach at 75%, and their corresponding mosquito sequence at 35.12% just surpassed the threshold of pairwise structural validity set above 30%. The local model quality obtained from ProSA web server ranks AFM above SMM and CMM in that order, even though all models had good <i>z</i>-scores. Ramachandran plot paints a different picture where the CMM have a higher percentage of residues in the accepted zone and AFM have a few residues in the wrong places. However, the data from VADAR statistics show that AFM models are more thermodynamically stable with lower fraction of buried amino acids or charges. Docking studies conducted on UCSF Chimera software showed similarity in active site residues for AFM and SMM involved in a number of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. These include residues GLU202, LEU102, ASP95, and ASP105 for cockroach models and residues VAL24 and LEU174 for mosquito models. The active site of all protein models contains some identical residues found in bound complexes including GLU, LEU, APS, and SER, which happen to be in different positions. ANOVA analysis revealed no significant difference in docking energies, an indication that even when active site residues are different, they still conserve the essential qualities needed for binding. Thus, despite the differences in structures, based on validation evaluation, such differences are unlikely to affect binding with octopamine. However, for studies where the quaternary structure of a protein is crucial, the AFM that preserves the full quaternary structure is recommendable.
40060723	Temporal Variation in Bacterial Community Characteristics Shaped by Habitat in a Reservoir Buffer Strip in China.	Habitat and temporal variation can both influence microbial community dynamics, although their relative importance in reservoir buffer zones with complex hydrology regimes and dramatically altered environments remains controversial. To elucidate this, we investigated spatiotemporal variation in soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes from the flooding period to the dry period (April and June, respectively) using high-throughput 16S amplicon sequencing in three habitats (abandoned cropland, grassland, and woodland) within the Chushandian Reservoir's buffer strip, China. The results showed that habitat was more important than temporal variation in shaping soil bacterial diversity and ecological processes in the reservoir buffer zone. Bacterial communities responded to temporal variation both in terms of species composition and function; temporal variation affected bacterial communities mostly by altering the abundance of shared species and by causing the resurgence or extinction of specific taxa within the same habitat. The main driver of these changes was the resilience capacity of habitats to the changing moisture environment. The magnitude and underlying mechanisms of the changes in bacterial community diversity and ecological processes differed markedly between the three habitats, owing mostly to the characteristics of their vegetation, thus the allocation ratios of different habitat vegetation types and landscape diversity should pay attention for the reservoir buffer zone management, improving the integrated ecological benefits of the reservoir ecosystem from a multiscale.
40060593	Reference Library for Suspect Non-targeted Screening of Environmental Toxicants Using Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry.	As our health is affected by the xenobiotic chemicals we are exposed to, it is important to rapidly assess these molecules both in the environment and our bodies. Targeted analytical methods coupling either gas or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS or LC-MS) are commonly utilized in current exposure assessments. While these methods are accepted as the gold standard for exposure analyses, they often require multiple sample preparation steps and more than 30 minutes per sample. This throughput limitation is a critical gap for exposure assessments and has resulted in an evolving interest in using ion mobility spectrometry and MS (IMS-MS) for non-targeted studies. IMS-MS is a unique technique due to its rapid analytical capabilities (millisecond scanning) and detection of a wide range of chemicals based on unique collision cross section (CCS) and mass-to-charge ( <i>m/z</i> ) values. To increase the availability of IMS-MS information for exposure studies, here we utilized drift tube IMS-MS to evaluate 4,685 xenobiotic chemical standards from the Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) program including pesticides, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). In the analyses, 3,993 [M+H] <sup>+</sup> , [M+Na] <sup>+</sup> , [M-H] <sup>-</sup> and [M+] <sup>+</sup> ion types were observed with high confidence and reproducibility (≤1% error intra-laboratory and ≤2% inter-laboratory) from 2,140 unique chemicals. These values were then assembled into an openly available multidimensional database and uploaded to PubChem to enable rapid IMS-MS suspect screening for a wide range of environmental contaminants, faster response time in environmental exposure assessments, and assessments of xenobiotic-disease connections.
40060473	Deletion of core septin gene <i>aspB</i> in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> results in fungicidal activity of caspofungin.	Septins are a family of GTP-binding proteins found in many eukaryotic lineages. Although highly conserved throughout many eukaryotes, their functions vary across species. In <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, the etiological agent of invasive aspergillosis, septins participate in a variety of processes such as cell wall organization of conidia, septation, and response to cell wall stress. Previous studies determined that the Δ<i>aspB</i> strain had a greater sensitivity to anti-cell wall drugs, especially the echinocandin caspofungin, yet mechanisms behind this augmented sensitivity are unknown. We performed cell viability staining of the deletion strains post-caspofungin exposure and found that the Δ<i>aspA</i>, Δ<i>aspB</i>, and Δ<i>aspC</i> strains have significantly lower cell viability. Concomitant with the reduced viability, deletion strains are more susceptible to caspofungin on solid media. These results indicate that the septin cytoskeleton is important for <i>A. fumigatus</i> survival in the presence of caspofungin. Due to the potential of improved therapeutic outcome, we followed up using a neutropenic murine model of invasive aspergillosis. Animals infected with the Δ<i>aspB</i> strain and treated with caspofungin showed improved survival compared to the animals infected with <i>akuB</i> <sup>KU80</sup> wild-type or complemented strains. Additionally, histological analysis showed reduced fungal burden and inflammation in the Δ<i>aspB</i> infected, caspofungin-treated group. Affinity purification coupled with quantitative proteomics identified proteins involved in the septin-dependent response to caspofungin, includng four candidate interactors involved in cell wall stress response. Deletion of these candidate genes resulted in increased susceptibility to caspofungin and moderately reduced viability post-drug exposure. Taken together, these data suggest that septin AspB contributes to the fungistatic response to caspofungin.
40060289	Biofilm-mediated bioremediation of xenobiotics and heavy metals: a comprehensive review of microbial ecology, molecular mechanisms, and emerging biotechnological applications.	Environmental pollution, driven by rapid industrialization and urbanization, has emerged as a critical global challenge in the twenty-first century. This comprehensive review explores the potential of bacterial biofilms in bioremediation, focusing on their ability to degrade and transform a wide array of pollutants, including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), oil spills, pesticides, and emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals and microplastics. The unique structural and functional characteristics of biofilms, including their extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, enhanced genetic exchange, and metabolic cooperation, contribute to their superior pollutant degradation capabilities compared to planktonic bacteria. Recent advancements in biofilm-mediated bioremediation include the application of genetically engineered microorganisms, nanoparticle-biofilm interactions, and innovative biofilm reactor designs. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has shown promise in enhancing the degradative capabilities of biofilm-forming bacteria while integrating nanoparticles with bacterial biofilms demonstrates significant improvements in pollutant degradation efficiency. As global pollution rises, biofilm-based bioremediation emerges as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to address diverse contaminants. This review signifies the need for further research to optimize these techniques and harness their full potential in addressing pressing environmental challenges.
40060111	Integrating AI detection and language models for real-time pest management in Tomato cultivation.	Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> L.) cultivation is crucial globally due to its nutritional and economic value. However, the crop faces significant threats from various pests, including <i>Tuta absoluta</i>, <i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>, and <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i>, among others. These pests not only reduce yield but also increase production costs due to the heavy reliance on pesticides. Traditional pest detection methods are labor-intensive and prone to errors, necessitating the exploration of advanced techniques. This study aims to enhance pest detection in tomato cultivation using AI-based detection and language models. Specifically, it integrates YOLOv8 for detection and segmentation tasks and ChatGPT-4 for generating detailed, actionable insights on the detected pests. YOLOv8 was chosen for its superior performance in agricultural pest detection, capable of processing large volumes of data in real-time with high accuracy. The methodology involved training the YOLOv8 model with images of various pests and plant damage. The model achieved a precision of 98.91%, recall of 98.98%, mAP50 of 98.75%, and mAP50-95 of 97.72% for detection tasks. For segmentation tasks, precision was 97.47%, recall 98.81%, mAP50 99.38%, and mAP50-95 95.99%. These metrics demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods, indicating the model's effectiveness. The integration of ChatGPT-4 further enhances the system by providing detailed explanations and recommendations based on detected pests. This approach facilitates real-time expert consultation, making pest management accessible to untrained producers, especially in remote areas. The study's results underscore the potential of combining AI-based detection and language models to revolutionize agricultural practices. Future research should focus on training these models with domain-specific data to improve accuracy and reliability. Additionally, addressing the computational limitations of personal devices will be crucial for broader adoption. This integration promises to democratize information access, promoting a more resilient, informed, and environmentally conscious approach to farming.
40059747	Structurally modified carbon nanotubes as twisted fibers towards electrochemical detection of environmentally hazardous cartap.	Pesticides such as cartap play a crucial role in agriculture, as they are extensively used in controlling pests in crops like sugarcane, rice and vegetables. However, their excessive usage poses major threats to human health, causing neurotoxicity and respiratory disorders. In addition, they harm aquatic ecosystems by disrupting biodiversity. Consequently, effective detection and remediation are essential to minimize their adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem. For this purpose, an electrochemical method was used for the simultaneous detection and degradation of the under-reported insecticide cartap. In this work, vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays were grown and converted into fibers <i>via</i> simple mechanical spinning and used as a flexible electrode material for cartap electro-oxidation. The fabricated electrode exhibited excellent performance towards sensing and remediation without any surface modification. The fiber-based electrode showed a wide linear range, a low detection limit (LOD) of 0.575 mM, high sensitivity (7.98 μA cm<sup>-2</sup> mM<sup>-1</sup>), reproducibility, and excellent electrocatalytic activity. The multi-functionality of this electrode was attributed to its unique properties like flexibility, compatibility with various media (aqueous and organic), cost-effectiveness, and seamless integration with membranes, making these fibers promising candidates for on-site facile detection and long-term degradation of cartap.
40059727	Engineering Two-Dimensional-Copper Phenolic Nanosheet from CuO Nanosphere for Enhanced Peroxidase Activity in Smartphone-Based Thiophanate-Methyl Detection via Analyte-Inhibition Mechanism.	Optical sensors based on nanozymes have shown great promise for the rapid and sensitive detection of pesticide residues in environmental and food samples. However, their applicability is often limited by a lack of selectivity due to nonspecific enzyme inhibition. Therefore, we developed a colorimetric sensing platform specifically tailored to detect the agricultural fungicide thiophanate-methyl (TpM), leveraging its unique inhibitory effect on nanozyme activity. The symmetric ethylenediamine- and bisthiourea-like groups in TpM exhibit a strong affinity for metal sites, leading to a reduction in the catalytic performance. Thus, we designed a novel copper oxide nanosphere (CuO)-derived 2D copper phenolic nanosheet (2D-CuPNS) with enhanced peroxidase-like activity. This nanosheet facilitates the oxidation of TMB through OH radical generation via a Fenton-like reaction involving Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Cu<sup>+</sup> and -C═C- bonds on the nanozyme surface. Notably, the activity of 2D-CuPNS was selectively and significantly inhibited by TpM due to a specific interaction while remaining unaffected by other pesticides. The 2D-CuPNS exhibited strong affinities for TMB and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, with <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values of 0.07 and 2.0 mM, respectively. As a result, the proposed sensor demonstrated high specificity for TpM detection, with a linear range of 0.5-15 μM and a low detection limit of 0.09 μM. A smartphone-assisted rapid detection method was also developed utilizing RGB values from the chromogenic reaction. Furthermore, by immobilization of the 2D-CuPNS and TMB substrate onto standard filter paper, ready-to-use paper-based TpM sensors were created. This study introduces a novel nanozyme inhibition approach for the selective detection of TpM in environmental and food samples, providing a versatile and practical sensing solution.
40059629	Genetic diversity in the IIS6 domain of voltage gated sodium channel gene among Aedes aegypti populations from different geographical regions in India.	This study provides critical insights into the genetic diversity of the IIS6 domain of the Voltage Gated Sodium Channel (VGSC) gene in Aedes aegypti populations across various regions in India, focusing on two mutations: S989P and V1016G. Samples were collected from seven different cities across the country, including Dibrugarh, Kolkata, Berhampur, Bhopal, Bengaluru, Ghaziabad, and Aurangabad. The IIS6 domain was amplified and sequenced, revealing that the V1016G mutation was found at a higher frequency compared to the S989P mutation. The S989P mutation was most prevalent in Berhampur, followed by Bengaluru, while the V1016G mutation showed high frequencies in Dibrugarh, followed by Berhampur. Additionally, the study identified intron polymorphisms within the VGSC gene, with the type A intron being relatively rare. However, the type A intron was observed in samples harbouring both mutant and wild alleles for both mutations. The regional variation in the frequencies of these mutations indicates complex evolutionary dynamics potentially influenced by local environmental factors and insecticide application practices. Interestingly, the high frequency of these alleles also correlated with the genetic structure of the mosquito populations, suggesting that gene flow might be playing a role in spreading these mutations. Regular monitoring of these mutations could serve as important indicators in assessing the status of resistance to pyrethroids and guide nationwide mosquito control efforts. This research underscores the necessity for localised vector control strategies and continuous genetic surveillance to manage insecticide resistance effectively.
40059550	Development of a Pesticide Labeling Literacy Scale for Thai Rice Farmers: Item Generation and Content Validity Testing.	Occupational exposure to pesticides in rice cultivation poses health risks, exacerbated by factors contributing to the improper use of pesticides. One significant factor is the limited literacy skills of farmers, hindering their ability to read and comprehend pesticide labels. Research in this area is limited by the lack of an acceptable method for measuring pesticide labeling literacy.
40059268	The oligosaccharyltransferase subunit PsSTT3A regulates N-glycosylation and is critical for development and virulence of Phytophthora sojae.	In eukaryotes, N-glycosylation is a complex, multistep process in which the core subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase, Staurosporine and Temperature Sensitive 3A (STT3A), plays a critical role in the catalytic activity of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. We found that the PsSTT3A gene plays a critical role in the viability of Phytophthora sojae (P. sojae). Furthermore, full PsSTT3A function was crucial to mycelial growth, sporangium production, zoospore production, and pathogenicity, as determined by gene silencing experiments. PsSTT3A is, itself, a highly N-glycosylated protein with six consensus NXS/T (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) motifs and one novel NS motif. However, the N-glycosylation sites on PsSTT3A that are required to support the development and virulence of P. sojae have been uncertain. Here, we demonstrated that glycosylation of site N593 is essential for normal mycelial growth and virulence in P. sojae. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis was disrupted by the mutation of N593. N593A mutations reduced the stability of the elicitin PsSOJ2A, an N-glycoprotein, in gene replacement transformations. Our study reveals the functional significance of N-glycosylation of PsSTT3A in the development and infection cycles of P. sojae, demonstrating that targeting of PsSTT3A may be a promising strategy for developing new mode of action fungicides.
40059115	Evaluation of soybean germplasms for resistance to stay-green syndrome.	Stay-green syndrome (SGS) resistant germplasms serve as the cornerstone for soybean improvement. A comprehensive assessment was conducted on a panel of 1553 germplasms to evaluate their resistance to SGS through natural inoculation. Over a three-year period, one landrace, ZaoShuHeiDou, emerged as resilient to SGS, displaying a significantly reduced risk of SGS (p < 0.05) compared to its counterparts. The broad-sense heritability of SGS resistance was 0.86. Notably, landraces demonstrated a substantially lower incidence of SGS compared to improved cultivars. Furthermore, the severity of SGS correlated with several key traits pertinent to soybean improvement efforts. In field trials, the application of insecticides effectively mitigated SGS severity, whereas the use of organic fertilizers and soil sterilization had no discernible impact. A total of 83 DNA samples were successfully amplified from SGS-afflicted plants using specific primers for soybean stay-green associated virus (SoSGV), and a SoSGV LCU-1 strain was isolated. The qPCR analysis confirmed a positive correlation between SGS severity and the relative SoSGV copy number in afflicted plants. The findings of this study lay a solid foundation for the development of SGS-resistant cultivars and the exploration of underlying resistance mechanisms.
40059061	Rate of herbicide resistant weed development: A Canadian Prairie case study.	Genetically modified crop adoption in Canada has been the key driver in removing tillage as the lead form of weed control, due to increased weed control efficiency. Land use has transitioned from the use of summerfallow to continuous cropping, predominantly involving zero or minimum tillage practices. Prairie crop rotations have diversified away from mainly cereals to include three-year rotations of cereals, pulses, and oilseeds. Total herbicide volume applied has increased as crop production acres increased, but the rate of herbicide active ingredient applied per hectare has declined. Diverse crop rotations allow for weed control using herbicides with different modes of action, reducing selection pressure for resistant weed development. Herbicide-resistant weeds are an important concern for farmers, as the loss of key herbicides would make weed control exceedingly more difficult. The objective of this case study is to examine herbicide resistance weed development in the Canadian Prairies and to identify changes in resistance development following GM crop adoption.
40058903	Characteristic flavor compounds in soy protein isolate and their correlation with sensory attributes.	A molecular sensory analysis of soy protein isolate (SPI) was conducted using headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS/O), along with flavor recombination and omission experiments. Twenty-six odor-active compounds were identified, with hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, (E)-2-nonenal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal as characteristic flavor compounds contributing to grain husk, grassy, raw bean, tofu, oil oxidation, and soy milk flavors. The identification of these compounds in the olfactory references, combined with descriptive sensory analysis under varying concentrations, revealed a significant correlation between sensory attributes and the composition and concentration (p < 0.05). Grassy and raw bean were associated with all compounds; grain husk was linked to hexanal, heptanal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal; tofu was associated with octanal, nonanal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal; oil oxidation was related to hexanal, octanal, nonanal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal; and soy milk was correlated with hexanal, nonanal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal. Flavor intensity generally increased with compound concentration. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the subsequent flavor enhancement of soy protein products.
40058743	Mitigating pesticide risk on bee pollinators and angiosperm biodiversity in the Ndop wetlands: A conservation approach.	This study aimed to assess the risk of pesticides on bee pollinators and propose strategies to conserve entomophilous angiosperm species in the Ndop wetlands. Results showed that the applied pesticide doses were often excessive, increasing the exposure toxicity ratios (ETR). Among the pesticides, insecticides posed the highest risk to bee pollinators, with Emamectin benzoate (ETR=591.4) presenting the highest risk, followed by imidacloprid (ETR=517.5), fipronil (ETR=496.4), chlorpyrifos (ETR=240.7), and cypermethrin (ETR=131). Lambda-cyhalothrin (ETR=50.53) posed a possible risk. The study found that imidacloprid, fipronil, and chlorpyrifos posed definite risks through dietary exposure, while Emamectin benzoate, fipronil, and cypermethrin posed risks through direct contact. Approximately 46.03% of angiosperms are anemophilous while 53% are entomophilous with bee pollinators facilitating the pollination of nearly 90% of the entomophilous species. To mitigate pesticide risks and for conservation purposes, farmers should refrain from applying pesticides during blooming and peak pollinator activity times, particularly midday.
40058615	MEK1 inhibition ameliorates mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis induced by deltamethrin in mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells.	Deltamethrin (DM), a widely used pyrethroid insecticide, has been increasingly recognized as a risk factor for neurodegeneration. However, the underlying mechanism is still far from clear. In this study, we investigated whether MEK1 is involved in DM-induced neurotoxicity and mediated mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. In mouse hippocampal neuron HT22 cells model, DM (2,10,50 μM) dose-dependently increased apoptotic cells rate and impaired mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as significantly upregulated of apoptotic related proteins Bax, cytochrome c (Cyt-c) and Caspase-3 were observed. RNA-sequencing analysis further revealed that the MEK/ERK signal pathway was remarkably enriched and activated after DM exposure. In particularly, upregulation of MEK1, other than ERK1/2, was detected at both transcriptional and translational levels. Inhibition of MEK1 can effectively result in the recovery of mitochondrial morphology and MMP in DM-treated HT22 cells. And that further alleviated apoptosis by reversing the overexpression of Bax, Cyt-c and Caspase-3. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the critical role of MEK1 in regulating mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis induced by DM, providing a novel understanding of the neurotoxicity of DM.
40058553	Chronic exposure to tebuconazole impairs offspring growth and survival in farmland birds: an experiment in captive house sparrows.	European farmland bird populations have declined by over 60% in 40 years, with the use of pesticides suspected to be one of the main causes of this decline. However, it remains difficult to test the impact of these pesticides in field studies due to confounding environmental variables that can also affect avian wildlife (e.g., food resources, habitat fragmentation and alteration). Triazoles are a family of fungicides that are ubiquitous in agro-ecosystems due to their use on a wide range of crops. Triazoles are suspected to affect non-target avian species by disrupting key physiological mechanisms and by detrimentally affecting their reproduction. In this captive study, we experimentally investigated the effect of the most commonly used triazole fungicides (i.e., tebuconazole) on the reproduction of an avian species representative of farmlands, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). We examined the impacts of tebuconazole at realistic concentrations (550 μg.L<sup>-1</sup> in drinking water to achieve ∼ 60 pg.g<sup>-1</sup> in plasma of sparrows) under controlled conditions on multiple indicators of breeding performance (clutch size, hatching success, chick growth and survival). We found that chronic exposure to tebuconazole (9 months, including the breeding period) significantly altered the reproduction of sparrows. Although clutch size and hatching success were not affected by tebuconazole, chicks from the exposed group showed reduced growth and a higher mortality rate. Interestingly, these effects were exacerbated in female chicks, highlighting a sex-dependent effect of tebuconazole on sparrow offspring. This study demonstrates that tebuconazole can be detrimental to the reproduction of farmland birds. Further studies are now required to distinguish the direct effects of tebuconazole (toxic and sublethal effects on the developing chick/embryo) from the indirect ones (alteration of egg quality and parental care).
40058441	TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber incorporating hydrophobic TA-HBPSi nanoparticles aerogels for efficient adsorption of fungicides in water.	Fungicide contamination is a critical environmental issue, and the effective removal of fungicide residues from aquatic environments has attracted significant attention from researchers. In this study, the synthesized hyperbranched polysiloxane (TA-HBPSi) was grafted onto TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers (TOCNF) to fabricate a novel aerogel material (TA-HBPSi@TOCNF) with the aim of enhancing the sorption efficiency of fungicide. The equilibrium maximum adsorption capacity of TA-HBPSi@TOCNF for imazalil (8.04 mg/g) was significantly higher compared to other fungicides, including prochloraz (6.43 mg/g), thiophanate-methyl (4.12 mg/g), carbendazim (0.16 mg/g), and thiabendazole (0.04 mg/g). In the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>, the equilibrium adsorption capacity for imazalil increased from 8.04 mg/g to 9.61 mg/g, while the adsorption capacity for Cd<sup>2+</sup> increased from 0.26 mg/g to 0.88 mg/g. Quantum chemical calculations were performed at the density functional theory (DFT) level. The energy gaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ΔE(<sub>HOMO-LUMO</sub>)) for various adsorption mechanisms indicated that electrostatic interactions were the dominant driving force for adsorption, followed by π-π electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interactions and hydrophobic interactions. The developed aerogel demonstrated effective multi-component separation capabilities without inducing secondary environmental pollution, highlighting its potential as a promising candidate for practical water purification applications.
40058304	Nationwide prediction of pesticide residual levels in soil: Implications on the resulting risk and prioritization framework.	Pesticides are widely accumulated in agricultural soils in China under successive applications, causing negative impacts on non-target species and environmental qualities. However, a nationwide overview of the residual levels of pesticides in soil, and the ecological risks to non-target soil species are lacking. In this study, we calculated geographically gridded concentrations of 107 pesticide active ingredients (AIs) in soils in China based on the Computational Pesticide Input (CPI) model and further assessed the ecological risks to soil biota. In the end, we proposed an integrated usage-impact model to identify prioritize control pesticides based on the usage, risk and persistence of pesticides. Pesticide concentrations were calculated in a range from 0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to over 185 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Glyphosate is the most prevalent pesticide that exists in most locations. The ecological risks were mostly assessed as medium risk, with extreme high- and high risk found in 1 % and 21 % of soils. Supervision and management of azoxystrbin, boscalid, butachlor and chlorpyrifos need to be prioritized. The results of this study provide guidance to local governments for the designation more accurate risk mitigation strategies across regions.
40058301	Community-level effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide on the metabolism of freshwater microorganisms.	This study provides an ecotoxicological assessment of the effects of the neonicotinoid dinotefuran on freshwater microorganisms. Epilithic biofilm was sampled from a small stream and exposed to dinotefuran for 14 days in Biolog EcoPlates. In general, we found that a concentration of 0.100 mg l<sup>-1</sup> of dinotefuran induced the microorganism community to catabolise carbon sources faster. However, catabolic activity varied depending on the type of carbon source. Catabolism increased for Putrescine (+4673 %), Serine (+376 %), Galacturonic Acid (+206 %), Pyruvic Acid Methyl Ester (+177 %), and Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (+113 %); and decreased for Arginine (-59 %), Asparagine (-26 %), and Mannitol (-21 %). This is the first study in which EcoPlates have been used to investigate the effects of dinotefuran on freshwater epilithic biofilm at an environmentally realistic concentration.
40058209	Caddisfly emergence is substantially affected by the combined exposure of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, natural organic matter and UV irradiation.	Nanoparticles serve various industrial and domestic purposes which is reflected in their steadily increasing production and ultimate release into the environment. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles pose due to their high production volume and their photoactive properties a potential environmental risk. Here we assessed their impact in combination with UV and natural organic matter (NOM) at field relevant intensities on the emergence dynamics and quality of the aquatic insect Chaetopteryx villosa (Insecta: Trichoptera) employing a factorial test design. While UV alone and the combination of TiO<sub>2</sub> with UV or NOM reduced emergence by 50 %, the combination of all three factors (i.e., TiO<sub>2</sub> x UV x NOM) caused an even stronger effect (i.e., reduction by 70 %). Following a similar pattern, the time until 50 % of the larvae emerged was, depending on the treatment, delayed by at least 5.9 and up to 16.4 days. In contrast, the nutritious quality of adult C. villosa, characterized in terms of energy reserves and fatty acid profiles, was hardly affected. Nonetheless, the substantial impact in emergence dynamics was at the same magnitude as reported for highly toxic chemicals, such as insecticides. Consequently, (photoactive) nanoparticles may be of similar environmental concern, particularly under joint exposure with further environmental factors (i.e., UV and NOM). Moreover, and in the light of the central ecological role of aquatic insects at the interface between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, the present study points towards far-reaching consequences for the riparian food web and the productivity of this meta-ecosystem.
40058200	A novel framework for industrial pesticide effluent assessment: Integrating chemical screening, multi-endpoint responses and literature-based validation.	Industrial pesticide effluents pose substantial risks to aquatic ecosystems, yet comprehensive understanding of their toxicological impacts remains limited. This study presents an integrated approach to evaluate the ecological risks of pesticide manufacturing effluents through chemical screening and multi-endpoints biological responses. Using zebrafish embryos as a model organism, we demonstrated that effluent discharge point (EDP) sample induced 100 % mortality, while diluted samples exhibited significant developmental toxicity, cardiovascular injury, immunosuppression, and behavioral alterations. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying these toxic responses. Through chemical screening and targeted quantification, we identified three predominant azole fungicides - propiconazole (2.11 μg/L), hexaconazole (13.3 μg/L), and tebuconazole (18.66 μg/L) - that exhibited synergistic toxicity. Notably, our innovative meta-analysis framework based on literature data validated the toxicological profiles of detected compounds, providing an efficient alternative to conventional bioassays. This study establishes a comprehensive framework for assessing industrial effluent toxicity and demonstrates the value of integrating chemical analysis with biological responses for environmental risk assessment.
40057618	C(sp<sup>3</sup>)-heteroatom bond formation by iron-catalyzed soft couplings.	Carbon-heteroatom bonds are of great importance due to their prevalence in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, materials, and natural products. Despite the effective use of metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions between sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized organohalides and soft heteroatomic nucleophiles for carbon-heteroatom bond formation, the use of sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized organohalides remain limited and the coupling with thiols remains elusive. Here, we report the coupling of sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized benzyl or tertiary halides with soft thiol nucleophiles catalyzed by iron and extend the utility to alcohol and amine nucleophiles. The reaction is broad in substrate scope for both coupling partners and applicable in the construction of congested tri- and tetrasubstituted carbon centers as well as β-quaternary heteroatomic products. The synthetic utility is further emphasized by gram-scale synthesis and rapid herbicide library synthesis. Overall, we provide an efficient method to prepare pharmaceutically and materially relevant carbon-heteroatom bonds by expanding iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions to the coupling of sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized organohalides with soft nucleophiles.
40057536	Potent targeted larvicidal activities of marine-derived Bacillus sp. bacterial extracts on mosquito vectors.	Mosquito vector-borne diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity across the globe. Current vector control strategies mainly rely on chemical insecticides, but their incessant usage has resulted in the development of resistance. Insecticidal agents of microbial origin have proven as good alternative tools for vector control of mosquito. In the present study, we examined larvicidal activities of the extracts from culture supernatants of marine bacteria (extracts) against major mosquito vectors from India. Out of 55 tested marine bacterial extracts, 12 extracts caused 90-100% mortality at 250 ppm in Anopheles stephensi larvae. Furthermore, NIO 707 and 706 were found to be significantly effective against Aedes aegypti larvae and field collected larvae of An. subpictus, respectively. Some of the extracts (NIO 701, 707 and 710) demonstrated significant reduction in egg hatching of An. stephensi; while all the tested extracts were able to significantly reduce egg hatching in An. culicifacies. Additionally, we observed that any of the effective extracts did not show any detrimental activity against malaria parasite (Plasmodium falciparum). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the effective extracts belonged to Bacillus sp.; however, bacteria from Enterococcus genera was a peculiar finding of our study. Altogether, our data underscores the importance of exploration of marine bacteria from Indian peninsula for their larvicidal activities and further undertaking mechanistic approach to develop novel bio-larvicides.
40057515	Larval spongy moth transcriptomic response to ingestion of broad-versus narrow-spectrum insecticidal Chromobacterium species.	The PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> strain of Chromobacterium subtsugae was the first insecticidal bacterium to be registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use in crop protection applications since approval for Bacillus thuringiensis was granted in 1961. C. subtsugae, a Gram-negative betaproteobacterium, exhibits oral toxicity against a broad range of important insects, including dipteran, coleopteran, lepidopteran, and at least some hemipteran and tetranychidan pests. Chromobacterium sphagni is a closely related bacterium exhibiting a distinctly narrower activity spectrum than that of C. subtsugae: it is toxic to lepidopteran, but not dipteran or coleopteran pest insects. The molecular mode of activity for either species is not well characterized at present, and it remains unclear whether these bacterial species affect insects similarly, notwithstanding their close evolutionary relatedness. In this study, synchronized third-instar larvae of the destructive lepidopteran forest pest, Lymantria dispar dispar (European spongy moth), were separately fed with cultures of C. subtsugae strain PRAA4-1<sup>T</sup> or C. sphagni strain 14B-1<sup>T</sup> and sampled after 24 h post infection. Gene expression levels in healthy reference versus treated insects were independently compared at the whole-insect and midgut-only tissue levels to characterize host-specific transcriptional responses to intoxication. Treatment induced up-regulation of such antimicrobial peptides as attacin and cecropin, of two cytochrome P450-encoding genes, and of gelsolin, a molecule involved in actin organization. Some differentially expressed genes were novel or uncharacterized, hence future work with lepidopteran species will be necessary to understand insect physiological responses to Chromobacterium infection.
40057353	The impact of training on satisfaction and anxiety levels in stroke patients receiving warfarin treatment.	Due to the narrow therapeutic range of warfarin, patients require close monitoring. This study aimed to examine the effects of training provided to stroke patients receiving warfarin treatment on their perception of satisfaction and state of anxiety.
40057165	Preliminary vegetation-based evaluation of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) using pine species: Towards pollution data comparability.	Pine needles are suitable biomonitors of airborne semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). However, the various pine species, each with unique distribution and ecological traits, may differ in their ability to retain pollutants. The SVOC uptake capacities between different vegetation species remain largely unknown, and this study seeks to address this gap. By establishing comparable SVOC retention levels, different species could be used interchangeably, strengthening the data consistency across studies and clarifying diverse pollution cycles. Four SVOC classes - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) - were analyzed in pine needle samples from various species in 12 sites in Portugal, Spain, the UK and Romania, to explore interspecies pollutant correlations. In general, the SVOC levels found were indicative of the urban fingerprint as expected, despite of the tree species. Although it was not intended to define a clear uptake trend for all species, statistically significant relationships (p < 0.05) were found in the most sampled ones (P. pinaster, P. pinea, P. sylvestris) for the total concentration of the SVOCs families for some individual compounds, especially the most volatile. These links appear to be transversal to land use (urban, background/remote), the different climate regimes of the sampled areas, and even the inherent variability of vegetation, allowing for cross-national/land use data to be compared. To enhance the scope of future studies, the spatial and temporal increase of sampling campaigns is needed, although the selection of the appropriate sites can be challenging.
40057161	Exposure to polystyrene microplastics with different functional groups: Implications for blood pressure and heart.	The association between microplastics (MPs) exposure and cardiovascular disease is largely unknown. It is still unclear what effects MPs exposure have on blood pressure and how it affects the heart. As MPs age, their surfaces undergo modifications that may alter how the MPs interact with cells, which may affect the extent of their toxic effects. Here, we used three different surface functional-group polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs), and exposed 5-week-old SD rats to them over 42 days. Compared with the control group, the mean blood pressure of the MPs exposed rats increased by 22-40%. Exposure to PS-MPs caused oxidative damage to the heart, and induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. More interestingly, MPs modified by functional groups induced enhanced adverse effects than unmodified PS-MPs, with amino-modified PS-MPs exhibiting more significant blood pressure elevation and myocardial hypertrophy. Proteomic analysis of cardiac differential proteins focused on factor XII activation, negative regulation of proteolysis, collectively pointed to the downregulation of kininogen. We demonstrated that MPs exposure induced ERK activation, the down-regulation of bradykinin, and inhibition of the downstream nitric oxide signaling pathway. This study demonstrates the different effects of MPs with different functional groups on blood pressure elevation and myocardial hypertrophy, and sheds light on the mechanisms responsible for microplastic-induced cardiovascular toxicity.
40057072	Function of chitinase in Penicillium ochrochloron Q-3-1 and its insecticidal and antifungal mechanism and biological control against citrus pests and diseases.	The biocontrol potential strain of Penicillium ochrochloron Q-3-1 was isolated from Hepialus armoricanus larvae. However, the insecticidal and antifungal mechanisms of Q-3-1 are still unclear. Eleven chitinase genes (Poch1-Poch11) were isolated for functional identification. During Q-3-1 infection, Poch1, Poch2, and Poch11 were upregulated in Galleria mellonella, whereas Poch4, Poch6, and Poch11 were upregulated in Diaphorina citri. Chitinase activity was determined based on the expression of the chitinase genes in an in vitro prokaryotic expression system and an analysis of the p-nitrophenol (pNP) degradation ability of recombinant chitinase. They exhibit excellent degradation activities for chitin, citrus pectin, D-cellobiose, and G. mellonella epidermis. The exonuclease activity of Poch1 can effectively degrade insect chitin and pectin. The insect chitin utilization rate of Poch11 is higher than that of pectin, and it can randomly degrade different pNP substrates. In addition, the present study found that exogenous chitinase proteins showed significant antagonistic ability against citrus pathogens. The special antifungal and insecticidal character of Q-3-1 may lead to its potential application in agriculture as a biological control agent.
40056919	Mapping the global prevalence, incidence, and mortality of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria, 2000-22: a spatial and temporal modelling study.	Malaria remains a leading cause of illness and death globally, with countries in sub-Saharan Africa bearing a disproportionate burden. Global high-resolution maps of malaria prevalence, incidence, and mortality are crucial for tracking spatially heterogeneous progress against the disease and to inform strategic malaria control efforts. We present the latest such maps, the first since 2019, which cover the years 2000-22. The maps are accompanied by administrative-level summaries and include estimated COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts on malaria burden.
40056864	Unlocking the potential of Eudrilus eugeniae in mitigating the pollution risk of pesticides and heavy metals: Fostering machine learning tactics to optimize environmental health.	Agro-industrial waste management remains a critical challenge in sustainable development, particularly due to contamination with heterogeneous micropollutants such as heavy metals (HMs), pesticides, and polyphenols. This study explores an innovative vermistabilization approach using pineapple pomace (PP) to enhance the bioremediation of paper mill sludge (PMS) facilitated by Eudrilus eugeniae. The research demonstrates that the contrasting pH profiles of PMS (a highly alkaline substrate) and PP (a highly acidic substrate) have significantly contributed to nutrient enhancement and stabilization of end products for the mixed feedstock treatments (PP and PMS-based feedstocks) compared to the feedstock treatments in isolations. Results demonstrated a 2.1 fold increase in earthworm population density, and 4-5 fold reduction in organic carbon content confirming its effectiveness of biostabilization in a heterogeneous feed mixture. Vermicomposting enhanced nutrient availability (N, P, K) and microbial metabolic activity by 3-5 folds. Amongst tested ratios, PP + PMS + cowdung (CD) (1:2:1) achieved optimal remediation, reducing HMs (Cd, Pb, Zn, Hg, Ni, Cu, Cr), pesticides (chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, carbofuran), and polyphenols by 8-9 folds. Integration of Artificial Neural Networks coupled with Sobol sensitivity analysis also identified PP + PMS + CD(1:2:1) as the most effective combination in minimizing potential health risks. Furthermore, Taylor plot analysis determined the best-fit model for predicting health risks associated with various PP and PMS-based complex systems. The findings underscored the potential of utilizing PP along with PMS based feedstock for mitigating pollutants whilst simultaneously enhancing nutrient recovery during vermicomposting. Thus, the machine learning techniques could facilitate the optimization of feedstock compositions, advancing large-scale vermistabilization as a sustainable strategy for agro-industrial waste management.
40056814	Organophosphate pesticides and their potential in the change of microbial population and frequency of antibiotic resistance genes in aquatic environments.	Heavy metals (HMs) and pesticides disrupt aquatic biodiversity and microbial communities, contributing to antibiotic resistance via cross-resistance and co-selection mechanisms. This study investigates the relationship between organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), HMs, microbial diversity, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in eight lakes and wetlands. Microbial communities were analyzed via metagenomics methods, and data were processed using CLC Genomics Workbench 22. ARGs, including tetA, tetB, qnrA, qnrS, CIT, Fox, KPC, CTX-M1, DHA, GES, OXA, IMP, VEB, NDM1, SHV, TEM, CTX-M, PER, and MOX, were identified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Element concentrations and pesticide were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. The results indicate that environmental elements and pesticides significantly influence microbial diversity. Proteobacteria (Gamma, Beta, Alpha) dominate over other bacteria in all locations. β-Lactamase resistance genes have a significant positive correlations with the concentrations of boron, iron, lithium, magnesium, sodium, and phosphorus (P-value<0.05). Positive correlations between phosphorus, iron, and beta-lactamase genes suggest that higher concentrations of these elements may increase resistance likelihood by promoting resistant bacterial growth or facilitating gene transfer. Additionally, tetA and tetB exhibited a significant positive correlation with parathion concentration. The results showed that OPs and HMs increase antibiotic resistance by causing gene mutations, altering gene expression, and promoting horizontal gene transfer, resulting in multidrug-resistant strains. This highlights the need for monitoring these pollutants as they affect microbial diversity and accelerate antibiotic resistance. Targeted measures, such as bioremediation and pollution control, are essential to mitigate risks to the environment and public health.
40056554	Bioaccumulation of PCBs and OCPs in Antarctic phytoplankton and zooplankton: Insights into bioconcentration and biomagnification in Fildes Bay.	This study was conducted at Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, from November 30th, 2019, to January 30th, 2020. We determined the concentrations of Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) and Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in phytoplankton, and zooplankton. The most abundant compounds found were hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in phytoplankton and γ-HCH in zooplankton. We estimated the bioconcentration factors (BCF<sub>PHYTO</sub>) for phytoplankton and zooplankton (BCF<sub>ZOO</sub>), as well as biomagnification factors (BMF) across trophic levels. Our findings indicate that BCF values were generally higher for compounds with a higher degree of chlorination, and noticeable biomagnification of these contaminants was observed, emphasizing the enhancement of contaminant concentrations from phytoplankton to zooplankton. This biomagnification varied depending on the specific compound and environmental conditions. Throughout the study period, the factors influencing bioconcentration and biomagnification were closely correlated with the seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton biomass, which were affected by local conditions such as slower S and SE winds. These events enhanced the concentration of chlorophyll-a and POPs, influencing their transfer across trophic levels. Our study underscores the complex interplay between biotic and abiotic factors in determining the fate of these persistent pollutants in a rapidly changing polar environment. These findings highlight the need for continuing ongoing monitoring to understand the long-term impacts of environmental changes on the distribution and behavior of hazardous substances in remote regions like Antarctica.
40056550	Prenatal exposure to organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls and risk of testicular germ cell cancer later in life.	Exposure to environmental chemicals during fetal development may increase the risk of testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC), but few studies have tested the hypothesis. We focused on organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), previously investigated in relation to other male reproductive health outcomes.
40056522	Elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying degradation of nicosulfuron and its derivative by Klebsiella jilinsis 2N3 using multiomic analysis.	Nicosulfuron is a herbicide used in agricultural production. Its prolonged application causes significant ecological risks to soil and water environment. In this study, the molecular mechanisms underlying degradation of nicosulfuron and its derivative by Klebsiella jilinsis 2N3 was determined. Strain 2N3 degraded nicosulfuron primarily via cleavage of the sulfonylurea bridge and deamination and demethoxylation of its derivative, 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine (ADMP). Multiomic analysis indicated significant alterations in genes and proteins predominantly associated with glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, quorum sensing, signal transduction, energy metabolism, and nucleotide synthesis. Heterologous expression and gene knockout confirmed that degradation of the sulfonylurea bridge in nicosulfuron by strain 2N3 was accompanied by a hydrolysis process, in which arginine hydrolase Kj-CY657_RS10725 participated in nicosulfuron degradation Deletion of its gene decreased the biodegradation rate of nicosulfuron by 11.04 % in 24 h. Moreover, our study demonstrated that nicosulfuron derivative ADMP can effectively dock within the active site of the Kj-CY657_RS01600 protein, forming hydrogen bonds that enhanced the catalytic activity. Kj-CY657_RS01600 could degrade 10 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> ADMP by 43.08 % within 30 min, resulting in the formation of 4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine as a byproduct. Additionally, after Kj-CY657_RS01600 knockout, the ability of strain 2N3 to biodegrade ADMP decreased by 52.48 %. This study provided molecular mechanism for comprehensive understanding the biodegradation of nicosulfuron and its derivative ADMP by strain 2N3.
40056504	Antioxidant defense response mediated by DAF-16 attenuates toxicity of herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on Caenorhabditis elegans.	Glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are widely used herbicides in agriculture for weed elimination. These unused glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are discharged into environmental water, soil, and even in the food chain cycle, which greatly threatens ecosystems and human health. However, the toxicological mechanism of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms remains largely unknown. To investigate the toxic effects of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium on soil non-target organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans which is directly exposed to various pesticides in the soil was selected as the object of study. In this study, our results showed that the locomotion, growth, reproduction, and lethality of C. elegans exposed to different concentrations of a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are suppressed. Exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium increases the production of reactive oxygen species, accelerating senescence and shortening the lifespan of C. elegans. The exposure to a mixture of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium activates antioxidant defense responses mediated by DAF-16 and autophagy mediated by SKN-1. Our research provides a novel perspective on the mechanism underlying antioxidant defense response-mediated detoxification of pesticide residues in soil non-target organisms.
40056347	Global research trends on the human exposome: a bibliometric analysis (2005-2024).	Exposome represents one of the most pressing issues in the environmental science research field. However, a comprehensive summary of worldwide human exposome research is lacking. We aimed to explore the bibliometric characteristics of scientific publications on the human exposome. A bibliometric analysis of human exposome publications from 2005 to December 2024 was conducted using the Web of Science in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Trends/hotspots were investigated with keyword frequency, co-occurrence, and thematic map. Sex disparities in terms of publications and citations were examined. From 2005 to 2024, 931 publications were published in 363 journals and written by 4529 authors from 72 countries. The number of publications tripled during the last 5 years. Publications written by females (51% as first authors and 34% as last authors) were cited fewer times (13,674) than publications written by males (22,361). Human exposome studies mainly focused on air pollution, metabolomics, chemicals (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), endocrine-disrupting chemicals, pesticides), early-life exposure, biomarkers, microbiome, omics, cancer, and reproductive disorders. Social and built environment factors, occupational exposure, multi-exposure, digital exposure (e.g., screen use), climate change, and late-life exposure received less attention. Our results uncovered high-impact countries, institutions, journals, references, authors, and key human exposome research trends/hotspots. The use of digital exposome technologies (e.g., sensors, and wearables) and data science (e.g., artificial intelligence) has blossomed to overcome challenges and could provide valuable knowledge toward precision prevention. Exposome risk scores represent a promising research avenue.
40056346	Acaricides in agriculture: balancing livestock health and environmental well-being in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya.	Extensive use of chemicals in food production, although useful, has profound implications. Acaricides, extensively used to control ticks and mites in livestock farming, can leave harmful residues that pose risks to unintended organisms such as plants, insects, people, and other animals. Thus, limiting non-target exposure to acaricides is critical. This study is aimed at assessing acaricide knowledge, use, and disposal methods among farmers and agrochemical dealers in Trans-Nzoia County, Kenya, which is well-known for livestock farming. A purposive survey of stakeholders, including 100 farmers and 45 agrochemical shop attendants, revealed concerning practices. The findings revealed insufficient personal protection during acaricide application, with a minority of responders using gloves (33%), safety goggles (0%), masks (42%), or overalls (51%) for agrochemical dealers and gloves (8%), overalls (48%), safety goggles (2%), and masks (28%) for farmers. Furthermore, used acaricide containers and residues were not properly disposed of after spraying, potentially contaminating water sources, soil, and plants. Insects, particularly bees and house flies, were spotted consuming leftovers from unprotected disposal sites, entering food webs. Furthermore, animal drying sections in spraying regions included grass, allowing animals to ingest residues. Recommendations include improved acaricide monitoring and management by extension field staff and educating farmers and pesticide dealers about health concerns, proper disposal techniques, and the importance of wearing personal protective equipment. A regulation requiring agrochemical dealers to sell acaricides together with protective gear is recommended to limit dangers effectively.
40056341	Shikonin Ameliorates Rotenone-Induced Neurotoxicity Through Inhibition of Apoptosis via IGF-1R/PI3K/AKT Pathway in a Parkinson's Disease-Associated SH-SY5Y Cell Model.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder caused by several genetics and environmental factors. Rotenone a pesticide with mitotoxicity causes cytosolic proteopathy resulting in PD-associated apoptosis and modulations in cell survival pathways. Shikonin, a naphthoquinone compound extracted from the Lithospermum erythrorhizon herb, was investigated in this study for its neuroprotective properties and underlying molecular mechanisms against rotenone-induced cellular apoptosis and survival in SH-SY5Y cells. The molecular docking analysis of apoptotic proteins against Shikonin revealed that they showed a binding affinity with BAD. Shikonin effectively countered the loss of cell viability induced by rotenone, rescued annexin-positive apoptotic cells, and dose-dependently suppressed the generation of reactive oxygen species. Pre-treatment with Shikonin prevented the morphological aberrations like shrining of neurites leading to decreased LDH leakage and NO release caused due to the rotenone treatment. The α-synucleinopathy is a prime hallmark of PD, Shikonin mitigated the rotenone-induced aggregation of α-synuclein as seen from confocal imaging. Furthermore, Shikonin treatment reversed the rotenone-induced excessive production of reactive oxygen species, activation of caspases (-8 and -3), and mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by the restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels. Western blot and qPCR analysis revealed that Shikonin heightened the IGF1R/PI3K/AKT signaling associated with cell survival while concurrently downregulating rotenone-induced intrinsic apoptotic pathways. These findings underscore Shikonin as a promising candidate to prevent the onset of pesticide-induced Parkinson's disease and potentially other oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative disorders.
40056242	Non-transgenic RNAi strategies for sustainable plant viral disease control: a review.	Viruses are a major cause of plant disease with an estimated annual economic impact of over $30 billion. They account for nearly 50% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and re-emerging plant diseases worldwide. To confer resistance against these diseases RNA interference (RNAi) technology can be employed. Designing silencing molecules like dsRNA homologous to the viral genome has been the most common non-transgenic method to induce RNAi mediated resistance in plants. dsRNAs are carefully tailored and produced considering factors such as the type of virus, target genomic region, dsRNA size, and method of application to maximise their efficiency. With the advent of new technologies like nano-platforms, a sustainable carrier can be developed to deliver these molecules, enhancing their stability and its bioavailability. This innovative technology faces regulatory debates globally and lacks legislation for commercialisation. But this is an eco-friendly alternative to conventional pesticides that can revolutionize the future of plant viral disease management, providing a bio-safe and an evergreen solution.
40056241	First-principles studies of the SCl<sub>2</sub> adsorption on the doped boron phosphide monolayer.	Sulfur dichloride (SCl<sub>2</sub>) molecules form a harmful substance; however, it is widely used in the industry as insecticide and in organic synthesis. In contact with water, these molecules produce other toxic and corrosive gases. Therefore, it is important to remove them from the environment. In this work, we have studied the boron phosphide (BP) monolayer (ML) doped with metal atoms to be considered as a sensor material for the detection of sulfur dichloride (SCl<sub>2</sub>) molecules. Studies are done by applying the density functional theory (DFT) according to the PWscf code of the Quantum ESPRESSO, using the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method within the framework of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE parameterization. The results obtained indicate weak interactions between the SCl<sub>2</sub> molecule and the pristine BP monolayer. However, after metal-doping (with atoms of: Ga, In, N and As) the interactions between the SCl<sub>2</sub> molecule and the ML was increased, as expected. Parameters such as the adsorption energy (E<sub>ad</sub>), work function (Ф), Bandgaps (E<sub>g</sub>), recovery time (τ), electronegativity (χ) and chemical potential (μ) have been analyzed. The results suggest that the metal-doped BP monolayer may be a promising sensing material for gas sensor devices to detect SCl<sub>2</sub> molecules.
40056226	Condensed low-dose total skin electron beam therapy for mycosis fungoides: an institutional retrospective review and subgroup analysis of patients with large cell transformation.	Low-dose total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) is an effective treatment option for mycosis fungoides (MF) with proven palliative effects and reduced toxicity. Presented is an institutional analysis of survival/response rate and quality of life for MF patients with subgroup analysis of those possessing pathologic large cell transformation (LCT). This is a single institutional retrospective review of patients with mycosis fungicides treated from 2014 to 2023 with low-dose TSEBT. All patients received 12 Gy in 6 fractions every other day with the modified Stanford technique, with boosts to shadowed sites between treatments, completed in 2 weeks. Outcomes evaluated included clinical response, duration of and time to response, patient-reported quality of life, and physician-scored disease burden. Forty-six patients were included in the study, 28 male and 18 female, with a median age 66.5 (range 32.7-90.6). Stage IB was most common at the time of TSEBT (41.3%). Median follow up was 44.5 months. The overall response rate was 91.3% (52.2% partial response, 19.6% complete and near complete response). The median duration of response was 8.2 months (range, 6.1-28.7), and the median time to best response was 3.5 months (range, 2.7-5.6). Quality of life (QOL) and disease burden continued to show significant benefit after TSEBT (p<0.001). In a subgroup analysis, 18 patients (39.1%) were found to have large cell transformation (LCT) at diagnosis. LCT was associated with higher presenting stage prior to TSEBT (p=0.016) and a better response to treatment (p=0.040). However, median duration of response was only 7.4 months in the patients with LCT vs. 39.4 months in the patients without (p=0.003). Condensed Low-dose TSEBT is a convenient treatment with favorable clinical outcomes and low toxicities in patients with mycosis fungoides. Patients with LCT may have shorter duration of treatment response. Further studies are warranted to validate this finding.
40056168	Exploiting TRP channel diversity in insects: a pathway to next-generation pest management.	Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels, a diverse family of over 30 ion channel subtypes, are pivotal in regulating sensory perception, thermoregulation, and feeding in insects. In Drosophila melanogaster, 13 TRP channels have been identified, while Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae possess 11 and 10, respectively, showcasing evolutionary adaptations to their ecological niches. This review explores recent advancements in understanding the structure, classification, and physiological functions of TRP channels, emphasizing their evolutionary divergence across Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera. Key TRP subfamilies, such as TRPA, TRPC, TRPM, TRPV, TRPN, and TRPP, are discussed, highlighting their roles in chemo-sensation, gustation, and stress responses. Examples include TRPA1's involvement in thermal sensing and TRPV's role in osmoregulation, critical for insect survival under fluctuating environmental conditions. The review highlights the potential of TRP channels as targets for pest control, focusing on TRP-specific insecticides like pymetrozine, afidopyrifen, and flonicamid, which impact feeding and sensory pathways. RNA interference (RNAi) techniques targeting TRP genes are highlighted as promising tools for innovative pest management. TRP channels' role in mediating thermal tolerance is particularly significant in the context of climate change, where variable temperatures challenge pest dynamics and agricultural sustainability. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for developing climate-resilient pest control strategies. The review also evaluates methodologies used in TRP channel studies, including genomic, transcriptomic, and functional assays, alongside behavioural analyses. Despite progress, challenges remain in studying TRP channels in non-model insects and elucidating their regulation. Future research should integrate multidisciplinary approaches to fully harness TRP channels for sustainable pest management.
40055830	Transposable elements in genomic architecture of Monilinia fungal phytopathogens and TE-driven DMI-resistance adaptation.	Fungicide resistance poses a significant challenge to plant disease management and influences the evolutionary dynamics of fungal pathogens. Besides being important phytopathogens, Monilinia species have become a model for discovering many fundamental questions related to fungal pathosystems. In this study, DMI-propiconazole sensitivity was investigated in view of transposable element (TE) dynamics in M. fructicola and M. laxa.
40055789	Intestinal myiasis caused by Clogmia albipunctata in Nepal: a case report.	Intestinal myiasis is a type of myiasis resulting from the accidental consumption of Clogmia albipunctata larvae. This type of myiasis generally displays symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention and discomfort, loss of appetite, weight loss, and intermittent diarrhea. It is a rare form of myiasis with relatively scarce literature in Nepal.
40054833	NAM-based analysis of contaminant short-term organ toxicity in HepaRG and RPTEC/TERT1 cells.	New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), including cell culture and multi-level omics analyses, are promising alternatives to animal testing. To become useable for risk assessment purposes they have to be applicable for different substance groups. One important group of substances is food contaminants, including synthetic chemicals, such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and natural compounds, such as mycotoxins and pyrrolizidine alkaloids. We tested five known contaminants affecting the liver and/or the kidney - PFOS, PFOA, Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AB<sub>1</sub>), lasiocarpine (Las), and cadmium chloride - using HepaRG and RPTEC/TERT1 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations for 36 and 72h. Our NAM-based testing protocol included marker protein analysis for cellular functions and targeted transcriptomics followed by bioinformatics pathway analysis. The effects observed were compared with established in vivo results. Protein analysis indicated various affected pathways in HepaRG cells, with generally fewer effects in RPTEC/TERT1 cells. The strongest transcriptional impact was noted for Las in HepaRG cells. This study demonstrated the test protocol's applicability across different substances, revealing significant differences between HepaRG and RPTEC/TERT1 cell lines. RPTEC/TERT1 cells, while expressing renal-specific CYP enzymes, were less suitable for detecting effects of substances requiring hepatic metabolic activation, like Las and AB<sub>1</sub>. Our data supports the concept of specific pathway toxicity, with pathway analysis enabling the prediction of effects based on mechanism rather than target organ. Employing multiple omics techniques provided comprehensive insights into various compound effects, including steatosis, reactive oxygen species production and DNA damage, highlighting the potential of an extended omics approach for advancing toxicological assessments.
40054824	Discovery of multi-chitinase inhibitors cinnamyl thiazolidinone compounds as candidates for insect growth regulators via ligand-based optimization strategies.	Chitinases are recognized as potential targets to develop novel insecticides to control lepidopteran pests. However, the design and development of effective multi-chitinase inhibitors remains a huge challenge. Based on the backgrounds, in this study, we designed and synthesized a series of cinnamyl-thiazolidinedione compounds as potential inhibitors against OfChtI, OfChtII and OfChi-h, for the first time, by integrating strategies including fragment replacement, 3D QSAR-guided design, and bioelectronic isosteric replacement. Among all synthesized compounds, those displayed substantial activities against three chitinases, such as 5f and 9m, simultaneously demonstrated significant larvicidal activities and growth regulation effects against various lepidopteran pests. Inhibition mechanism studies indicated that the π interactions, hydrophobic stacking, and electrostatic interactions between cinnamyl-thiazolidinone compounds and the conserved aromatic tryptophan and phenylalanine residues, as well as the polar asparagine residues in three chitinases, were crucial for their interactions. Furthermore, the qPCR experiment suggested that cinnamyl-thiazolidinone compounds could regulate the chitin metabolism pathway of Ostrinia furnacalis in vivo. This study provides the first successful example of developing novel multi-chitinase inhibitors through ligand-based optimization strategies, offering promising candidates for controlling lepidopteran pests.
40054780	Protective effects of Lavandula stoechas and Thymus numidicus essential oils against deltamethrin-induced hematological and biochemical toxicity in female rabbits.	Recent studies have shown that essential oils (EOs) extracted from medicinal and aromatic plants have herbicidal and/or insecticidal properties, helping to mitigate the toxicity experienced by living organisms exposed to pesticides. Moreover, the primary compounds isolated from these EOs also have the potential to reduce pesticide-induced damage. The present work aimed to evaluate the protective effects of Thymus numidicus (TNEO) and Lavandula stoechas (LSEO) against Deltamethrin-induced toxicity in female rabbits. The results obtained by GC/MS analysis showed that monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes were the main components of the EOs extracted from the aerial parts of Thymus numidicus and Lavandula stoechas. The use of the pesticide Deltamethrin caused significant damage to the liver and kidneys (p < 0.05), together with blood disorders, signs of restlessness and tremors. However, females treated with TNEO showed better tolerance than the group treated with LSEO. The combination of both oils showed more pronounced protective effects. This suggests a potential synergistic effect in reducing deltamethrin-induced toxicity.
40054662	Planktonic versus colony growth of Bacillus thuringiensis affects gene expression in vitro and infectivity against an insect host, Galleria mellonella.	The entomopathogenic bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, can complete its life cycle in environments of varying densities like insects, cadavers and soil. The stationary growth phase of the bacterial lifecycle includes virulent, necrotrophic and sporulation stages, which are under the control of pleotropic regulators of quorum sensing. In addition to insecticidal Cry-toxins, B. thuringiensis can generate quorum-dependent virulence factors. Herein, we investigated the development of B. thuringiensis under conditions of planktonic and colony growth. Using an insect host, namely Galleria mellonella larvae, we observed distinct virulence profiles and differential expression of quorum regulatory genes between B. thuringiensis from liquid planktonic growth and those colonies on a solid surface/medium.
40054562	Bioavailability assessment of propiconazole to Limnobium laevigatum and zebrafish (Danio rerio) in aquatic microcosms.	Residues of the triazole fungicide propiconazole (PCZ) in the environment can easily enter aquatic ecosystems through various pathways and accumulate in sediments, thus threatening ecosystem stability. The method of using passive sampling techniques to measure the freely dissolved concentration (C<sub>free</sub>) of pollutants in aquatic environments for assessing their bioavailability has been widely utilized in environmental risk assessments. This study employs oleic acid-embedded cellulose acetate membrane (OECAM) as a tool to determine the C<sub>free</sub> of PCZ in water. By establishing sediment spiking concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg in an aquatic microcosm, the distribution and bioaccumulation of PCZ in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and the aquatic plant Limnobium laevigatum (L. laevigatum) were examined over a 7-day period. During the experimental period, the concentrations of PCZ in the water for the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg treatment groups remained approximately 0.9 μg/L and 10.0 μg/L, respectively. After 7 days, the PCZ content in the sediments decreased by 22.74% and 14.94%, respectively. In both zebrafish and L. laevigatum, the concentration of PCZ initially increased and then gradually stabilized, with both species exhibiting moderate accumulation ability for PCZ. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) for zebrafish in the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg treatment groups ranged from 9.25 to 13.96 and 7.84-16.05, respectively, while those for L. laevigatum ranged from 28.17 to 31.40 and 23.01-36.11, respectively. By the end of the 7-day experiment, the total PCZ content in both treatment groups decreased by an average of 17.51%. Among them, L. laevigatum contributed significantly, highlighting its potential in accelerating the removal of PCZ from aquatic ecosystems.
40054561	Occurrence of Current-Use Pesticides in Sediment Cores from Lakes and Peatlands in Pristine Mountain Areas of Brazilian National Parks.	This study assessed the occurrence of current-use pesticides in sediment cores from six lakes and peatlands in high-altitude (1,952-2,374 meters) pristine areas within two southeastern Brazilian National Parks: Itatiaia National Park (IT-NP) and Serra dos Órgãos National Park (SO-NP). We sampled three sediment cores from lakes at IT-NP and three from peatlands at SO-NP, totaling 60 subsamples. Among the 38 current-use pesticides assessed, 17 were found in at least one sample, with 14 - including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and acaricides - identified in both parks. The most frequently detected pesticides were carbendazim and carbaryl (75-95%), followed by acetochlor, chlorpyrifos, diuron, metolachlor and tebuconazole (40-70%) and, to a lesser extent, terbuthylazine and malathion (10-30%). The organophosphates disulfoton (6.83 ± 20.18 ng g<sup>-1</sup> dry weight) and chlorpyrifos (4.34 ± 6.81 ng g<sup>-1</sup> dw) registered the highest concentrations across all compounds in the sediment layers, with chlorpyrifos showing the greatest relative abundance (65.9 - 92.8%) in four out of six sites. Risk characterization results revealed highest risk quotient (RQ) values (416-14,589) for chlorpyrifos, indicating potential ecological risks. High RQs were also obtained for acetochlor (5.76 - 94.6), carbaryl (0.4 - 4.08), carbendazim (0.09 - 3.46), diazinon (2048), disulfoton (34-569), diuron (1.45 - 35.0) and malathion (10.94). These results highlight the threat posed by long-range pesticide transport to pristine areas at National Parks. Urgent regulatory measures are needed to mitigate their impact and safeguard these ecosystems from degradation.
40054558	Assessing heavy metal pollution levels and associated ecological risks in peatland areas in the Mekong Delta region.	Heavy metal (HM) pollution in soils and sediment is a significant concern, yet its levels and ecological risks in peatland areas remain unexplored. This study evaluates these aspects in three peatland regions of the Long An province in Vietnam. Comparisons of HM concentrations in peatland sediments from Tan Thanh, Thanh Hoa, and Duc Hue provinces in the study locations revealed highest values in the Tan Thanh region. Specifically, Cu and Ni were found in sediments at levels two to three times higher than the threshold effects level (TEL) and the effects range median (ERL) guidelines. The main sources of HM pollution in the study area are predicted to include the production and use of fertilizers and pesticides, metal surface processing, mechanical engineering and electronics manufacturing, and chemical plants. Further, positive correlations between HM concentrations and factors such as pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and clay-silt ratio in the sediments were identified through Spearman correlation analysis. The results obtained from the correlation analysis were further corroborated by Bayesian network analysis, which was also applied in this study. In addition, the contamination factor (CF) index indicated that Ni has a pollution level of "moderate degree" in Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and "considerable degree" in Tan Thanh (CF = 3.2), whereas, Cu has a pollution level of "moderate degree" in both Thanh Hoa (CF = 1.3) and Tan Thanh (CF = 2.4). The modified degree of contamination (mCd) ranked the areas as Tan Thanh > Thanh Hoa > Duc Hue, with mCd indexes of 1.3, 0.7, and 0.4, respectively. The potential ecological risk index (RI) indicated a "low risk" level, with an average RI of 35.6 across all sites. These findings address knowledge gaps in HM pollution in peatlands but also contribute to the development of strategies for the protection of peatlands.
40054557	A gut bacterial supplement for Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) enhances host tolerance to nitenpyram: Insight from microbiota-gut-brain axis.	The widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides has severely impacted honey bees, driving population declines. Gut microbiota are increasingly recognized for their role in mitigating pesticide toxicity. This study evaluated the ability of Gilliamella sp. G0441, a core microbiome member of the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana), to confer resistance to the toxicity of a neonicotinoid nitenpyram. Newly emerged Asian honey bees were first colonized with gut microbiota in the source colony, then divided into four treatments: SS (fed sucrose solution throughout), SN (fed sucrose solution, then exposed to nitenpyram), GS (fed Gilliamella, then sucrose solution), and GN (fed Gilliamella, then exposed to nitenpyram), and their responses-mortality, food consumption, body weight, and sucrose sensitivity-were assessed. The protective effects of Gilliamella administration on the host were further validated using a microbiota-free bee model. Gilliamella supplementation significantly mitigated nitenpyram-induced appetite suppression, weight loss, impaired learning, and gut microbiota disruption. Mechanistic analyses revealed that nitenpyram disrupted brain metabolism via the intestinal MAPK pathway, reducing ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. Prophylactic Gilliamella treatment reversed these effects, restored metabolic balance, and modulated esterase E4 expression, enhancing pesticide resistance. This study underscores Gilliamella's vital role in honey bee resilience to neonicotinoids, offering insights into the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) as a pathway for enhancing pesticide tolerance and ecological health.
40054481	Selectivity of herbicides applied in the post-emergence of industrial hemp (<i>Cannabis sativa</i> L.).	The objective of this study was to evaluate the selectivity of four post-emergence herbicides in the cultivation of industrial hemp. Hemp was grown in 3.5 L pots with inert substrate in the absence of weeds throughout the crop cycle. The experimental design adopted was a randomized, complete block design with five treatments and four replications. The herbicides atrazine (2.500 g a.i./ha), clethodim (96 g a.i./ha), fomesafen (250 g a.i./ha), and nicosulfuron (54 g a.i./ha) were applied when the plants were approximately 35 days after cutting. Visual assessments of herbicide-induced injury symptoms were conducted, along with measurements of the number of leaves, plant height, stem diameter, and total aerial part dry mass. When nicosulfuron was applied after emergence, it caused 60.0% damage 21 days after application (DAA), which changed the number of leaves, height, stem diameter, and total aerial part dry mass of hemp plants in a big way. Fomesafen caused 42.5% injury at 5 DAA, and atrazine caused 42.5% injury at 21 DAA, which may compromise the final yield. Therefore, it is recommended to use only clethodim, a selective herbicide for broadleaf plants such as hemp, as it did not cause significant injuries during the evaluation period.
40054360	Localized nutrient management practices enhance the environmental-economic sustainability in potato production of China.	Potatoes, as the fourth most important staple crop in China, play a crucial role in ensuring national food security. However, potato production is heavily reliant on inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, leading to significant environmental challenges that compromise the sustainability of this production. A systematic evaluation of the current state of potato production sustainability in China and its potential for improvement is an urgent scientific issue that needs to be addressed. This study employs emergy sustainability index (ESI), energy return on investment (EROI), energy efficiency cost (EEC), and energy exchange ratio (EnER) methods to assess the environmental and economic aspects of potato production at the county level in China. Results indicate that, in 2015, the average ESI, EROI, EEC, and EnER for potato production in China were 1.37 (0.1-5.4), 2.21 (0.18-7.44), 0.06 (0.01-0.48) $/MJ, and 13.52 (2.68-112.40) MJ/$, respectively, with considerable spatial heterogeneity at the county level. Regions with higher sustainability in potato production are primarily concentrated in the northwest, which is also China's main potato-growing area. The random forest analysis identified yield, phosphorus, and nitrogen fertilizers as key factors influencing the sustainability of potato production. Regionally differentiated fertilizer management strategies led to a 43% and 35% increase in ESI and EROI, respectively, while EEC and EnER decreased by 50% and 47%. This study systematically explores the relationship between the environmental and economic dimensions of potato production from an energy perspective and proposes optimized management strategies for synergistic environmental-economic development. It provides methodological support and scientific guidance for promoting sustainable potato production and offers insights for global potato sustainability systems.
40054354	Assessment of the mechanism of combined toxicity of imidacloprid and triadimefon to Secale cereale L. seedlings under freeze-thaw cycle conditions.	Freeze-thaw (FT) cycles significantly stress crops in Northeast China, exacerbated by pesticide overuse, particularly affecting vulnerable seedlings during these periods. This study investigates the physiological responses of Secale cereale L. seedlings to the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) and the fungicide triadimefon (T) under simulated FT conditions. Our findings reveal that both pesticides impair photosynthesis in FT environments, resulting in increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and relative conductivity (RC). Furthermore, exposure to IMI and T enhances the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), while decreasing reduced glutathione (GSH) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels. Notably, combined stress resulted in significant increases of 80.26%, 16.36%, and 87.7% in RC, SOD, and POD activities, respectively, alongside substantial decreases of 65.87%, 46.34%, 63.74%, and 63.78% in net photosynthesis rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs), and water-use efficiency (WUE) in rye seedlings. Molecular docking analyses indicate that IMI and T interact with the active sites of SOD, POD, and APX through hydrogen bonding, compromising membrane integrity and inducing oxidative stress. While Secale cereale L. seedlings exhibit some resistance to IMI and T, FT conditions reduce this resilience. Correlation analysis reveals significant interactions between FT and pesticide stress on seedling physiology, suggesting that the concurrent use of IMI and T should be minimized in FT-prone areas. This study provides new insights into the pathways and mechanisms underlying the combined toxicity of IMI and T, offering a basis for assessing their environmental impacts on crops in regions susceptible to freeze-thaw cycles.
40054342	Interpretation of ecotoxicity tests using Enchytraeus albidus: Weight of soil characteristics in conditions of diffuse pollution.	One way to evaluate the impact of chemical substances released in the ecosystems is the use of terrestrial organisms in ecotoxicological bioassays. Enchytraeus albidus (Oligochaeta) is a species commonly used in such standardized bioassays aiming at identifying biological responses as life traits (survival and reproduction) using artificial spiked soils or in situ contaminated soils. However, in the latter case, it is known that other factors such as soil characteristics may affect the responses in E. albidus. We hypothesized that, in cases of low diffuse pollution, soil characteristics are major confounding factors that interfere with the interpretation of life trait responses in bioassays when their influence outweighs that of the diffuse pollution itself. To evaluate these confounding factors, 20 soils were collected from a low-contamination area encompassing diverse landscapes (urban, peri-urban, and rural) that exhibited gradients in pedological characteristics, biological parameters, and organic and inorganic contaminant levels, all within the range of classical values considered optimal for reproduction. E. albidus individuals were exposed to each soil sample, and survival and reproduction were monitored as life traits. Soil clustering and multifactorial analysis were employed to identify the confounding factors. Regardless of the life trait, low and sublethal contamination was rarely an explanatory factor for the responses of E. albidus. Survival was unaffected by soil characteristics or diffuse pollution. In contrast, reproduction was significantly and positively associated with soil pH and the levels of exchangeable sodium, calcium carbonate, molybdenum, PAHs, and insecticides, while it was negatively influenced by aluminum and exchangeable manganese. These findings suggest that studies conducted under conditions of diffuse, sublethal contamination should consider multiple natural soil characteristics in ecotoxicological bioassays to enable meaningful comparisons.
40054337	Structure and activity of a phosphinothricin N-acetyltransferase (PSPTO_3321) from Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.	Phosphinothricin inhibits plant glutamine synthetase and is used as a herbicide. Streptomyces hygroscopicus and Streptomyces viridochromogenes, which produce phosphinothricin naturally, encode acetyltransferases that confer phosphinothricin resistance. In the Pseudomonas genome database, a number of proteins have been annotated as phosphinothricin acetyltransferases and putative phosphinothricin acetyltransferases. One such protein is PSPTO_3321 from P. syringae, a strain that causes tomato speck. Here, we reveal that PSPTO_3321 from P. syringae, termed syr_pat, is a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, and also retains a lower level of activity against the structurally similar substrate methionine sulfoximine. We solved a 1.6 Å resolution crystal structure of syr_pat alone and a 2.5 Å resolution structure for a complex with <sub>L</sub>-phosphinothricin. We also characterised active site mutants, providing insights into substrate specificity. Our work now provides a basis for further study of the reaction mechanism.
40054312	Assessing the environmental impacts of engineering and agrochemical pollution in a historically-eutrophic estuary: The Mondego case (W Portugal).	The Mondego Estuary (W Portugal) experienced a process of eutrophication in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, making it one of the most impacted systems in southern Europe. To examine its recent environmental evolution, sedimentary records were analyzed from a multiproxy approach, involving biotic, sedimentological, geochemical, physical, and radionuclide data. Results evidenced the transformation of the estuary due to anthropogenic cumulative impacts. The closure of the upstream branch triggered rapid 'continentalization' in the southern arm, altering the hydrosedimentary regime and favoring eutrophication. However, the middle and lower sectors exhibited stronger marine influences. Foraminiferal biota responded effectively to management interventions to improve hydrodynamics, while showing no discernible ecotoxicological responses to agricultural discharges. Pesticide accumulations patterns are shaped by natural and anthropogenic factors, with strong agrochemical fingerprints in the upper and lower sectors. The topmost 20-cm layer of sediments contain high pesticide concentrations and microplastics, posing challenges for future management and pollutant mitigation.
40054289	Stir bar sorptive extraction TDU-GC-QToF-HRMS for screening 230 pesticides in waters surrounding banana plantations in Costa Rica through community engagement.	"The Gems of Water" citizens' engagement activity united the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission with the Costa Rican based NGO Coral Conservation to screen for pesticides in local rivers using wide-screening technology. Citizens used stir bar sorptive extraction to collect and extract samples from three rivers and two wells in the south Caribbean region of Costa Rica, an area known for export-based banana agriculture. The advanced wide-screening method provided by the JRC Water Laboratory enabled the assessment of 230 agrochemicals. While the JRC supplied the technical equipment and protocols, the pesticide screening to be investigated and the monitoring scheme were co-designed with Coral Conservation group members, a local NGO. The pilot study collected new data on pesticide occurrence and their toxicity in the local tropical environment, complementing on-going studies in the region. The study found 23 pesticides, the majority of which are fungicides registered for use in banana cultivation (azoxystrobin, difenoconazole, fluopyram, thiabendazole). Cumulative pesticide concentrations ranged from 5.3 ng/L in the upper catchment of the Estrella River (E-a) to 954.9 ng/L in the lower catchment of the Sixaola River (S-c), where the highest individual compound concentration was also recorded for fungicide azoxystrobin (425.0 ng/L). At the sampling sites along the Carbon River and in the lower catchment of the Sixaola River, compounds fenamiphos, fenpropathrin and azoxystrobin were the main responsible for the elevated toxic units (Toxic Units >0.01) for crustacean daphnia magna. Beyond highlighting the link between agrochemical occurrences in surface waters and surrounding land use, the citizens' engagement aspect promotes alternative water quality monitoring methods, raising awareness and scientific literacy in local communities and underscoring the value of bottom-up approaches.
40054280	Groundwater pollution management with source remediation and composite geomembrane cut-off wall: An analytical model and field investigation.	This study proposes a two-dimensional analytical model for contaminant migration through the composite GMB cut-off wall (CGCW) and aquifer system considering the effects of the leakage and source remediation. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol's method is conducted to investigate the key impacts of contaminant distribution and degradation rate in the source, cut-off wall retardation factor and Darcy velocity in CGCW. The results show that the performance of the CGCW significantly is controlled by the leakage. The peak contaminant concentration at the outlet of CGCW for large leakage (10<sup>-8</sup> m/s) can be 77.1 times larger than that for small leakage (10<sup>-11</sup> m/s), with a performance deterioration of 98.7 %. Additionally, the performance of the CGCW can be significantly enhanced by the source remediation technique. The CGCW will not be broken through when contaminant source degradation rate is larger than 2.9 × 10<sup>-8</sup> /s. Increasing the cut-off wall retardation factors (> 14.7) and decreasing the standard deviation of contaminant source distribution (< 0.1) can also improve the CGCW performance. Moreover, the analytical model coupled with the genetic algorithm is used for the CGCW leakage detection and performance prediction at an abandoned pesticide site based on the monitoring data. Accurate leakage detections in the field (with errors of < 5 m) can be achieved through the analytical solution, which is validated by the non-destructive high-voltage technique. The analytical solution can be an easy-to-use tool for the design, installation and construction of the CGCW at polluted sites.
40054240	Scarcity of pesticide data in New Zealand with a focus on neonicotinoids: A review.	Since Europe's 2018 neonicotinoid ban on outdoor use of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, there has been growing political, scientific, and public interest in further understanding the impact of neonicotinoids on bees and the environment. Here, we assessed the trends in pesticide use in New Zealand, with a particular focus on neonicotinoids, to aid discussion on their use and associated risks. Obtaining data on annual trends in pesticide quantities is challenging, as there is no central collection of pesticide data across the agrichemical or regulatory sectors in New Zealand. Consequently, the true scale and frequency of pesticide usage, including neonicotinoids, remain largely unknown. The difference in neonicotinoid use patterns between New Zealand, where 45 % of forage brassicas (annual planting) and pastures (infrequent planting) are grown from neonicotinoid-treated seeds, and northern hemisphere countries, where 56 % to over 90 % of annual food crops rely on neonicotinoid-treated seeds, indicates a lower overall neonicotinoid use in New Zealand. This difference underscores the need for region-specific approaches to pesticide management and regulation. Although residues can persist and migrate in the soil, current regulations only consider the risk of foliar spray to protect honey bees, overlooking the potential risks to native bees, which primarily live underground, as well as wider lethal and sublethal impacts of residues on non-target organisms. The lack of publicly accessible pesticide data limits scientific research on non-target and environmental effects, and the absence of readily available substitutes for neonicotinoids is the key challenge to be overcome in order to better manage the impact of these pesticides on New Zealand ecosystems.
40054238	Sublethal pesticide exposure decreases mating and disrupts chemical signaling in a beneficial pollinator.	Pesticides provide vital protection against insect pests and the diseases they vector but are simultaneously implicated in the drastic worldwide decline of beneficial insect populations. Convincing evidence suggests that even sublethal pesticide exposure has detrimental effects on both individual- and colony-level traits, but the mechanisms mediating these effects remained poorly understood. Here, we use bumble bees to examine how sublethal exposure to pesticides affects mating, a key life history event shared by nearly all insects, and whether these impacts are mediated via impaired sexual communication. In insects, mate location and copulation are primarily regulated through chemical signals and rely on both the production and perception of semiochemicals. We show through behavioral bioassays that mating success is reduced in bumble bee gynes after exposure to field-relevant sublethal doses of imidacloprid, and that this effect is likely mediated through a disruption of both the production and perception of semiochemicals. Semiochemical production was altered in gyne and male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), but not in exocrine glands where sex pheromones are presumably produced (i.e., gyne mandibular glands and male labial glands). Male responsiveness to gyne mandibular gland secretion was reduced, but not the queen responsiveness to the male labial secretion. In addition, pesticide exposure reduced queen fat body lipid stores and male sperm quality. Overall, the exposure to imidacloprid affected the fitness and CHCs of both sexes and the antennal responses of males to gynes. Together, our findings identify disruption of chemical signaling as the mechanism through which sublethal pesticide exposure reduces mating success.
40054200	Self-luminescent dual-ligand metal-organic framework based electrochemiluminescence probes for organophosphorus pesticides determination.	In this study, a signal amplification strategy was developed, which tris (2, 2'-bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) (Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup>) was incorporated as a guest molecule into the preparation system of lanthanide-based metal-organic framework (MOF). This strategy relied on strong electrostatic interactions and coordination competition to influence the growth process of the MOF, resulting in the firm immobilization of Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup> within the MOF structure. The spatial confinement effect of the MOF effectively improved the efficiency of electron transfer in the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction. The constructed ECL aptasensor using this MOF exhibited excellent performance, with limits of detection (LODs) for four organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), phorate, profenofos, isocarbophos and omethoate, as low as 0.0482 ng/mL, 0.0093 ng/mL, 0.0085 ng/mL, and 0.0893 ng/mL, respectively. This work has paved the way for a clever strategy of immobilizing Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup> molecules and amplifying signals, expanding the application of dual-ligand MOF, which provides valuable insights for future biosensor design.
40054159	Effect of temperature on the physiology and phytoremediation capacity of Spirodela polyrhiza exposed to atrazine and S-metolachlor.	Environmental toxicity of pesticides to aquatic plants can vary with temperature, as temperature affects plant metabolic processes. We exposed the globally distributed duckweed Spirodela polyrhiza to environmentally relevant concentrations (40 µg/L) of atrazine and S-metolachlor at temperatures typical of surface freshwater in temperate zones (10, 15, and 21 °C). Our objective was to assess the effects of low temperatures and herbicide concentration, and their interactions, on growth, photosynthesis, pigments, antioxidant enzymes, and phytoremediation capacity. Lower temperatures (10 °C) intensified the adverse effects of both herbicides on the quantum yield of photosystem II in S. polyrhiza, with photosynthesis being a more sensitive endpoint than biomass growth rate. Both in the control and herbicide treatments, plants exposed to 10 °C exhibited lower concentrations of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) and reduced ascorbate peroxidase activity, which may have contributed to the intensified negative effects on photosynthesis at this temperature. The removal of S-metolachlor was lower at 10 and 15 °C (3-8 %) compared to 21 °C (17 %), while no difference was observed between the three tested temperatures for atrazine (2-8 %). Our findings suggest that conducting pesticide toxicity tests at around 25 °C may underestimate the contaminants' inhibitory effects on aquatic plants during colder seasons and in temperate regions. Additionally, lower temperatures pose a challenge to the effectiveness of atrazine and S-metolachlor phytoremediation in aquatic environments.
40054114	Combating aggressive weeds: Reinforcing herbicide resistance in pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) through genome editing.	Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) is a drought-tolerant, tropical grain legume, rich in dietary proteins, vitamins, and micronutrients. However, the longstanding problem of weed infestation in the fields is a major constraint that significantly hampers the productivity of pigeonpea. Glyphosate, a widely used post-emergent, broad-spectrum, systemic herbicide, has emerged as an effective weed management strategy at the field level. It inhibits the chloroplastic enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) in the shikimate pathway by competitively inhibiting its substrate, phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP), thus curtailing the biosynthesis of essential aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan). This makes glyphosate lethal to weeds and the main crop as well. To address this susceptibility towards glyphosate, we developed glyphosate-resistant pigeonpea plants by modifying the PEP-binding site within the native CcEPSPS enzyme at positions 182G-to-A, 183T-to-I, and 187P-to-S, for reducing glyphosate binding affinity. The targeted base-editing was achieved using the CRISPR-Cas9-based homology-directed repair (HDR) technique. T<sub>2</sub>-edited plants harbouring mCcEPSPS exhibited stable inheritance of the these GATIPS mutations, reduced glyphosate binding affinity, and maintained optimal photosynthetic and agronomic parameters post-glyphosate application. The mCcEPSPS enzyme efficiently catalysed the transformation of PEP and S3P to EPSP and demonstrated in vitro resistance to glyphosate. In contrast to treated control (TC) plants, the edited plants possessed excellent photosynthetic, agronomic, and physiological metrics following a post-foliar Roundup (6 ml/L) spray. This work offers the first efficient and precise gene-editing report in pigeonpea, offering an effective, sustainable strategy for broad-spectrum weed management to mitigate both quantitative and qualitative crop losses.
40053875	Reduced Honeybee Pollen Foraging under Neonicotinoid Exposure: Exploring Reproducible Individual and Colony Level Effects in the Field Using AI and Simulation.	Honeybees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) are important pollinators. Their foraging behaviors are essential to colony sustainability. Sublethal exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids can significantly disrupt these behaviors, in particular pollen foraging. We investigated the effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on honeybee foraging, at both individual and colony levels, by integrating field experiments with artificial intelligence (AI)-based monitoring technology and mechanistic simulations using the BEEHAVE model. Our results replicated previous findings, which showed that imidacloprid selectively reduces pollen foraging at the colony level, with minimal impact on nectar foraging. Individually marked exposed honeybees exhibited prolonged pollen foraging trips, reduced pollen foraging frequency, and instances of drifting pollen foraging trips, likely due to impaired cognitive functions and altered metabolism. These behavioral changes at the individual level corroborated the previous model predictions derived from BEEHAVE, which highlights the value of combining experimental and simulation approaches to disentangle underlying mechanisms through which sublethal effects on individual foragers scale up to impact colony dynamics. Our findings have implications for future pesticide risk assessment, as we provide a robust feeding study design for evaluating pesticide effects on honeybee colonies and foraging in real landscapes, which could improve the realism of higher-tier ecological risk assessment.
40053830	A new diphenyl ether with insecticidal activity from the mangrove endophytic fungus <i>Aspergillus</i> sp. GXNU-DY2-12.	A new diphenyl ether pseudopithoether C (<b>1</b>), and five known compounds (<b>2-6</b>) were purified from secondary metabolites of the <i>Aspergillus</i> sp. GXNU-DY2-12 cultured in the rice medium. The new structure was analysed by NMR, HR-ESI-MS, and X-ray single crystal diffractometer. Compound <b>1</b> showed potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) - inhibiting activity and its IC<sub>50</sub> value was 1.02 μM. Notably, it demonstrated remarkable insecticidal efficacy against <i>Diaphorina citri Kuwayama</i>, achieving a mortality rate of 88% under standardised bioassay conditions.
40053730	Characterizing Public Sentiments and Drug Interactions in the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Social Media: Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis.	While the COVID-19 pandemic has induced massive discussion of available medications on social media, traditional studies focused only on limited aspects, such as public opinions, and endured reporting biases, inefficiency, and long collection times.
40053680	New Isoxazoline Cyclopropyl-Picolinamide Derivatives as Potential Insecticides.	Isoxazoline insecticides exhibit broad-spectrum insecticidal activity against insect pests. However, the high toxicity to honeybees limits their application in pest management. To explore reducing the toxicity of isoxazoline derivatives to bees, a series of new isoxazoline cyclopropyl-picolinamide derivatives were designed and synthesized. Bioassays revealed that <b>FSA37</b> showed excellent insecticidal activity against <i>Plutella xylostella</i>, <i>Spodoptera litura</i>, and <i>Spodoptera exigua</i>, with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.077, 0.104, and 0.198 mg/L, respectively. These results surpass those of fluxametamide, which displayed LC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.605, 0.853, and 1.254 mg/L. Furthermore, <b>FSA37</b> exhibited notable insecticidal activity against <i>Solenopsis invicta</i>. Importantly, bee toxicity studies indicated that <b>FSA37</b> possesses significantly lower acute oral toxicity compared to fluralaner and fluxametamide. Quantum chemical calculations and molecular docking studies suggest that the cyclopropyl-picolinamide fragment may be crucial for both biological activity and the safety of nontarget organisms. In conclusion, <b>FSA37</b> represents a promising candidate for a highly effective and environmentally friendly insecticide.
40053670	Discovery of Novel Isoxazoline Derivatives Containing Pyrazolamide Fragment as Insecticidal Candidates.	Lepidopteran species cause significant harm to agricultural yields and food quality. In this study, a series of innovative isoxazoline derivatives incorporating pyrazolamide moieties were carefully designed and synthesized as potential insecticidal agents. Among these, compound <b>F16</b> demonstrated an LC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.01 mg/L against <i>Plutella xylostella</i>, surpassing that of the lead compound fluxametamide (LC<sub>50</sub> = 0.15 mg/L). Furthermore, <b>F16</b> exhibited broad-spectrum insecticidal activity against <i>Pyrausta nubilalis</i>, <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i>, <i>Chilo suppressalis</i>, <i>Aphis craccivora</i>, and <i>Sogatella furcifera</i>. Notably, <b>F16</b> possessed low toxicity against <i>Danio rerio</i>, whereas fluxametamide displayed moderate toxicity. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis demonstrated that the potent insecticidal activity of <b>F16</b> is likely mediated by its specific interactions with γ-GABA receptors primarily through the formation of hydrogen bonds with key residues. Density functional theory calculations and molecular electrostatic potentials were also performed to gain insights into the insecticidal behavior of <b>F16</b>. These findings suggest that <b>F16</b> is a promising candidate for further investigation as a novel pesticide.
40053570	Natural occurrence of semicarbazide in heather honey.	Regulatory bodies aim to protect consumers from harmful substances. The use of certain antibiotics is prohibited in food-producing animals in the EU due to their potential detrimental effects on humans. Among these are nitrofuran antibiotics, which degrade rapidly so that their metabolites are used as markers in screening for their illegal use. The use of one metabolite, semicarbazide (SEM), as a marker for detecting the antibiotic nitrofurazone, has been criticized due to the many pathways it can be formed by and its natural occurrence in some food items. A recent change in the reference point of action (RPA) for SEM, as stated in Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/1871, due to a reassessment of sensitivity of the analyses, poses a problem for the export of heather honey in Norway. Norwegian heather honey seems to exceed the lowered RPA in numerous cases. Here we show that Norwegian heather honey samples, but not polyfloral 'summer' honey samples from the same hives, contain SEM. The simplest explanation for the demonstrated pattern is a natural source of SEM in heather honey, not the use of a banned antibiotic. Based on our results, we propose that an exception to the EU regulation should be added, exempting heather honey derived from <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> unless other nitrofurans or their metabolites are found together with SEM.
40053474	Degradation of Glyphosate to Benign N-Formyl Glycine Using MOF-808 Nanocrystals.	Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine, GPh) is an industrial herbicide used worldwide in modern agricultural practices. With the growing concerns about cumulative environmental and health effects, pathways for catalytic GPh degradation to benign products are becoming a pressing societal need. This report demonstrates that Zr-based metal-organic framework (MOF-808) with different crystal sizes and designed defect sites can be employed as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the complete degradation of GPh at room temperature. Importantly, the degradation mechanism produces N-formyl glycine and hydroxymethyl-phosphonate, which are largely innocuous chemicals, especially when compared to more common decomposition products that typically result in GPh degradation. Nanocrystalline MOF-808 (nMOF-808) exhibits enhanced reactivity than larger MOF-808 crystals, attributed to the higher coordination of hydroxyl and water molecules to the secondary building units (SBU) as determined using a range of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques. These studies indicate that the crystal size-dependency in GPh degradation is related to structural modifications on coordinative unsaturated Zr site that promote the fast exchange of weakly bonded ligands. Taken together, this study demonstrates that GPh degradation can be optimized through ligand field tuning in MOFs, which can help improve overall reactivity while also pushing the reaction toward desirable, non-toxic products.
40053147	Fluorescent aptasensor for detection of Salmonella typhimurium using boric acid-functionalized terbium metal-organic framework and magnetic nanoparticles.	A fluorescent detection platform was designed using boric acid-functionalized terbium metal-organic framework (BA-Tb-MOF) and carboxyl-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to identify Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) bacteria. Firstly, carboxyl-modified Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>MNPs were coated with specific aptamer (Apt-MNPs) as the capture probe for S. typhimurium. Then, the Apt-MNPs were added to the bacterial suspension to facilitate the targeted binding. Subsequently, the fluorescent probe (BA-Tb-MOF) was introduced into this solution. The BA-Tb-MOF was strongly attached to the bacterial surface through interactions between BA and glycolipids on the bacterial cell walls, forming a stable complex. As the bacterial concentration increased, the fluorescence intensity of the solution progressively decreased due to the binding and removal of bacteria-Apt-MNPs/BA-Tb-MOF complexes through magnetic separation. Under optimum conditions, the concentration of S. typhimurium and the fluorescence intensity showed an inverse linear relationship within the range of 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL, and the detection limit was 4 CFU/mL. The developed sensor showed high specificity against several other pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. The developed fluorescence platform also successfully detected the S. typhimurium in drinking water and egg samples with satisfactory recoveries (83-98%). This strategy can be investigated further for the detection of S. typhimurium and other pathogens in food and clinical samples.
40053133	A comprehensive evaluation of Naftifine's efficacy and safety in treating dermatophyte infections; systematic review and meta-analysis.	Dermatophyte infections, including tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea corporis (ringworm), and tinea cruris (jock itch), are widespread fungal infections that significantly impact global health and quality of life. Naftifine, an allylamine antifungal agent, is noted for its potent fungicidal activity, targeting fungal cell membranes by inhibiting squalene epoxidase. Additionally, Naftifine has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, enhancing its therapeutic potential. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of Naftifine in treating tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and tinea cruris, focusing on clinical outcomes, cure rates, and adverse effects to provide a thorough understanding of its effectiveness in managing these infections. This meta-analysis followed the PRISMA guidelines and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing naftifine's efficacy and safety in treating tinea pedis, corporis, and cruris. A systematic search was conducted in major databases from inception until February 9th, 2024. Eligible studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria, and data were extracted and analyzed using RevMan software. Seven multicenter RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Naftifine demonstrated superior efficacy compared to vehicle control in terms of complete cure rate (RR = 5.83, 95% CI [3.73 to 9.10]) with no significant heterogeneity (I2 = 0%), clinical improvement [RR = 1.55, 95% CI (1.21-2.00)], and treatment effectiveness [RR = 3.93, 95% CI (2.44-6.33)] for tinea pedis. Similarly, for tinea corporis and cruris, Naftifine demonstrated significant efficacy compared to vehicle control regarding complete cure rate, mycological cure rate, clinical improvement, and treatment effectiveness. However, there was no significant difference in adverse events between Naftifine and the vehicle across all three conditions. Naftifine is an effective topical treatment for tinea pedis, corporis, and cruris, with a favorable safety profile with no significant difference in adverse events compared to the vehicle.
40053044	Essential oils on the control of postharvest diseases of papaya.	Papaya is susceptible to fungal deterioration and the use of essential oils (EOs) emerges as a promising alternative to fungicides, which causes environmental and human health problems. To evaluate the antifungal activity of essential oils and their major constituents in controlling papaya pathogens, the following in vitro assessments were conducted: I) screening of seven EOs regarding the antifungal activity; II) determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the most promising EOs; III) analysis of chemical composition of the most effective oils; and IV) evaluation of the antifungal potential of the major constituents both individually or in combination. The results showed that the EOs of cinnamon bark, oregano, clove basil, and rosemary pepper exhibited high antifungal activity against all studied fungi, with MIC values from 0.50 to 2.00 μL mL-1. The major constituents found in oregano EO were carvacrol, ρ-cymene, and thymol; in cinnamon bark EO, cinnamaldehyde, o-methoxy, and cinnamyl; in rosemary pepper EO, thymol, ρ-cymene, and caryophyllene; and in clove basil EO, eugenol, ρ-cymene, and caryophyllene. Regarding the antifungal activity of the EO constituents, the mixture of the three major demonstrated greater efficiency against the studied fungi. Using constituents represents an alternative for controlling postharvest diseases in papaya.
40052866	The impact of adverse weather events on cockroaches and flies, and the possible effects on disease.	Climate change is associated with an increase in adverse weather events such as heatwaves, drought, hurricanes and typhoons, floods and wildfires. These extreme weather events can disrupt public health infrastructure and can be detrimental to hygiene and sanitation practices, leading to knock-on effects on populations of vectors associated with disease transmission. Both the frequency and intensity of climate-related adverse weather events are predicted to increase, likely resulting in changes to vector dynamics and vector-human interactions, leading to an increased risk of disease transmission. Yet, a gap exists in our knowledge of the impact of these events on hygiene and associated pest-borne diseases. A growing body of research connects two groups of pests (domestic flies and cockroaches) that are linked with poor hygiene and sanitary conditions to mechanical disease transmission. We present a review of these specific vectors' population biology and behaviour, links with hygiene and sanitation and how pest populations and public health could be affected by adverse weather events. There is evidence that increased temperatures, extreme rainfall and flooding events are most likely to be associated with increased fly and cockroach populations and changes in the behaviour or activity of these insects, which could exacerbate the risks of disease transmission. Warmer temperatures accelerate their rates of reproduction, while heavy rainfall and flooding disrupt their habitats, driving them indoors. Other factors like habitat destruction, breakdown in healthcare system infrastructure, population displacement and altered pesticide use following an extreme weather event are predicted to influence insect populations and provide opportunities for increased human -pest contact. We highlight research gaps and provide recommendations for the improvement of current domestic and professional pest control products and strategies that might be employed to mitigate the impacts of adverse weather events on hygiene-related pests in a changing world.
40052667	Evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of combination therapy with 1% ivermectin solution in moderate to severe rosacea: a cohort study.	<b>Introduction.</b> Rosacea is a common chronic dermatological disease that negatively affects the quality of life of patients.<b>Hypothesis.</b> Combination therapy with 1% ivermectin solution alongside systemic treatment methods is more effective in reducing the severity of moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea symptoms compared with traditional treatment methods alone.<b>Aim.</b> This study is aimed at finding new approaches to the treatment of moderate and severe forms of rosacea.<b>Methodology.</b> This research compared the main group receiving ivermectin with a control group getting conventional treatment to assess the safety and efficacy of 1% ivermectin combination therapy in 70 individuals with moderate to severe rosacea. At weeks 2, 4 and 8, the dynamics of clinical symptoms were evaluated using a 4-point scale.<b>Results.</b> The use of combination therapy with ivermectin led to a more pronounced improvement in the clinical picture. Already at week 4, a 48-54% decrease in symptoms was recorded in the main group, while in the control group, it was only by 25-30%. By week 8, an almost complete reduction of the main manifestations was observed in the main group (78-88% decrease). Regression analysis confirmed that combination therapy with ivermectin was a key factor determining a more substantial clinical improvement, regardless of age, gender and the initial severity of the patient's condition. In addition, a much more pronounced decrease in the number of Demodex ticks was recorded in the main group. The effectiveness of combination therapy with ivermectin did not depend on the demographic or clinical characteristics of patients, which makes it a universal method of treating rosacea. No serious side effects have been reported in any patient receiving combination therapy, which indicates its safety.<b>Conclusion.</b> This approach can be a valuable addition to existing strategies for the treatment of this chronic dermatological disease.
40052623	The miRNA-275 Targeting RpABCG23L is Involved in Pyrethroid Resistance in the Bird Cherry-Oat Aphid, a Serious Agricultural Pest.	<i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> is a global agricultural pest which had developed resistance to different insecticides. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter plays an important role in insecticide resistance. However, ABC transporters' role and regulatory mechanism in mediating <i>R. padi</i> 's response to pyrethroids are unclear. In this study, we found that <i>RpABCG23L</i> was significantly overexpressed in the pyrethroid-resistant strains of <i>R. padi</i>. Knockdown of <i>RpABCG23L</i> significantly increased the susceptibility of <i>R. padi</i> to lambda-cyhalothrin and bifenthrin. Luciferase reporter gene analysis showed that miR-275 binds to the <i>RpABCG23L</i> coding region and down-regulates its expression. Injection of miR-275 mimics significantly reduced <i>RpABCG23L</i> expression and increased <i>R. padi</i> susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin and bifenthrin, while miR-275 inhibitor injection enhanced <i>RpABCG23L</i> expression and increased tolerance to both insecticides. The results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the mechanism of miRNA-mediated pyrethroid resistance, and open up a new way for the development of miRNA-based biopesticides.
40052582	[Retracted] Genotoxicity of chloroacetamide herbicides and their metabolites <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.	Following the publication of the above paper, it was drawn to the Editor's attention by a concerned reader that certain of the JNK and phosphorylated (pho)‑JNK western blotting data shown in Fig. 8 on p. 7 were strikingly similar to data featured in a pair of other articles written by different authors at different research institutes, one of which (submitted to the journal <i>Molecular Medicine Reports</i>) has been subsequently retracted, whereas the other (submitted to the journal Renal Failure) was received at that journal prior to the receipt of the above article at International Journal of Molecular Medicine. In view of the fact that the abovementioned data had already apparently been submitted elsewhere prior to the receipt of this paper at <i>International Journal of Molecular Medicine</i>, the Editor has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal. The authors were asked for an explanation to account for these concerns, but the Editorial Office did not receive a reply. The Editor apologizes to the readership for any inconvenience caused.

40052247	Preimaginal development of Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) in brackish water gives rise to adult mosquitoes with thicker cuticles and greater insecticide resistance.	Aedes aegypti L. and Aedes albopictus Skuse mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), the principal vectors of many human arboviral diseases, lay eggs and undergo preimaginal development in fresh water. They have recently been shown to also develop in brackish water in coastal areas. Previous findings showed that Ae. aegypti larvae developing in brackish water possessed thicker cuticles and greater larvicide resistance than larvae developing in fresh water. The present study compared cuticle ultrastructure, resistance to adulticides, and the activities of adulticide detoxifying enzymes in female mosquitoes emerging from fresh and brackish water-developing Ae. aegypti preimaginal stages. The results showed that brackish water-derived females possessed significantly thicker tarsal and abdominal cuticles compared to fresh water-derived females. Brackish water-derived Ae. aegypti females were also significantly more resistant to three different types of pyrethroids and malathion compared to fresh water-derived females. Corresponding reversal of cuticle changes and adulticide resistance when preimaginal salinity was reversed showed that preimaginal salinity determined both procuticle structure and adulticide resistance in brackish water-derived females. Compared with fresh water-derived Ae. aegypti females, brackish water-derived females had similar activities of the adulticide-detoxifying enzyme families of esterases and glutathione S-transferases and a modest increase in the activity of monooxygenases, all of which were lower than the threshold values attributed to resistance in field populations of Ae. aegypti. Reduced permeability of the thicker and remodelled cuticles in brackish water-derived Ae. aegypti females to adulticides is proposed to be mainly responsible for their greater resistance to different types of adulticides. Greater salinity tolerance of preimaginal stages, adult cuticle changes and higher larvicide and adulticide resistance are inherited properties of brackish water-developing Ae. aegypti that reverse in a few generations after transfer to fresh water. This is compatible with a role for epigenetic changes in the adaptation of Ae. aegypti to brackish water. Greater resistance of salinity-tolerant Ae. aegypti to adulticides and larvicides poses a hitherto unappreciated problem for controlling arboviral diseases, with attendant implications also for other mosquito-borne diseases.
40051844	DROP app: A hydroclimate information service to deliver scientific rainfall, local rainfall, and soil moisture forecasts for agricultural decision-making.	Weather and Climate Information Services developed for agriculture often only provide scientific weather and climate forecasts on various timescales. Yet, local forecasts derived from indigenous knowledge and soil moisture information are still missing. In this study, we evaluate the implementation of the DROP app, a hydroclimate information service, offering both local (LF) and scientific rainfall forecasts (SF) and soil moisture forecasts, that was designed with and for smallholder farmers working on rainfed agriculture in northern Ghana. Results of the forecast assessment show that the LF generates a high probability of rain detection (POD), with a minimum value of 0.7. The hybrid forecast (HF) that integrates the SF and LF yields the highest POD value of 0.9 compared to others. However, the hybrid system also has a high number of false alarms which results in an overall lower forecast performance of HF compared to SF. Using forecasts obtained from the app, farmers adjusted their farming activities, such as time of sowing, planting and weeding dates, fertilizer and herbicide application, and harvesting. Although some limitations exist, the DROP app has potential to deliver actionable knowledge for climate-smart farm decision-making and thus, facilitate effective agriculture management.
40051695	Acute Poisoning Due to an Intentional Overdose of 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid.	Ethyl ester, chemically known as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), is a widely-used herbicide. It is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Class II moderately hazardous herbicide, and its accidental or intentional ingestion can lead to multiorgan dysfunction and death. Overlap in presenting symptoms to other chemical poisonings makes it crucial to have a high clinical suspicion for this poisoning diagnosis. Herein, we present a case of an intentional overdose of 2,4-D and highlight the clinical presentation and treatment measures used.
40051538	Assessing trends in non-coverage bias in mobile phone surveys for estimating insecticide-treated net coverage: a cross-sectional analysis in Tanzania, 2007-2017.	Monitoring insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage and use generally relies on household surveys which occur on a relatively infrequent basis. Because indicators of coverage are used to forecast the need for ITNs and aid in planning ITN distribution campaigns, higher frequency monitoring could be helpful to guide programme strategies. The use of mobile phone-based survey (MPS) strategies in low-income and middle-income countries has emerged as a rapid and comparatively inexpensive complement to large-scale population-based household surveys, considering the dramatic growth trend of mobile phone ownership.
40051450	Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance pyraclostrobin.	The conclusions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authorities of the rapporteur Member State Germany and co-rapporteur Member State Hungary for the pesticide active substance pyraclostrobin and the assessment of applications for maximum residue levels (MRLs) are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of pyraclostrobin as a fungicide and plant growth regulator on cereals (wheat, barley, oats, rye, triticale), maize (forage and grain) and potatoes. MRLs were assessed in sweet corn and fish. The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment and the proposed MRLs, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are reported where identified.
40050133	Removing autumn leaves in residential yards reduces the spring emergence of overwintering insects.	Seasonal fallen leaf removal is a common landscaping practice in urban ecosystems. Yet, we have little understanding of the practice's impact on overwintering arboreal arthropods that may use the habitat seasonally. To assess this yearly disturbance, we removed or retained fallen leaves in low and high-maintenance areas of pesticide-free residential yards in Maryland, USA. We recorded all individuals of 5 key aboveground arthropod taxa emerging over the following spring seasons and tracked environmental variables like belowground temperatures. Overall, leaf removal decreased the abundance of emerging arthropods by 17 %, with some taxa more negatively affected (moths and butterflies-45 %; beetles-24 %, spiders-up to 67 %) than others (flies, parasitic wasps). We further examined the impact of leaf removal on diversity and composition using two taxa important to land managers: (1) moths and butterflies as herbivores and pollinators and (2) solitary parasitic and predatory wasps as natural enemies of pests. Removing leaves reduced the diversity of moths and butterflies by about 40 %, changing community composition by decreasing the number of species that feed internally in leaves as larvae, overwinter as larvae, or overwinter in senesced leaves. Removal also altered beneficial parasitic wasp community composition, but not family diversity, with the most significant adverse effect on wasps in Eulophidae, a family specializing in parasitizing leaf-mining insects. Lastly, we used path analysis to explore how environmental variables around the overwintering site mediate moth and butterfly emergence patterns. While leaf removal led to more variation in spring soil temperatures, higher emergence was directly tied to greater leaf biomass and higher mean soil temperatures in high-maintenance yard areas with low canopy cover. Overall, a management strategy of retaining fallen leaves in yards may conserve insect biodiversity and associated services, increasing the ecological value of residential landscapes across two levels of management intensity.
40050071	Simultaneous Determination of Hormones in Botanical Dietary Supplements With Supramolecular Solvent-Based Extraction by HPLC-MS/MS.	Dietary supplements typically contain either natural products or synthetic chemicals. While botanical dietary supplements are often thought to be more natural and safer, they could still contain potentially harmful ingredients. Despite the detection of sex hormones in plants and soil, it is still worth examining if products made from plants contain them. In this study, simultaneous determination of 14 kinds of sex hormones in botanical dietary supplements was conducted by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). A suitable sample pretreatment method is expected to extract and purify the sample in a single step when detected by HPLC-MS/MS, enabling it to be directly injected into the instrument. Herein, supramolecular solvent (SUPRAS), composed of n-hexanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and water, was employed to extract hormones from botanical dietary supplements. The effect of various parameters, including the composition of the supramolecular solvents, their dosage, and vortex time, on extraction efficiency was investigated. The results demonstrated that the 14 compounds exhibited excellent linearity over the concentration range of 0.5-100 µg·L<sup>-1</sup>, with determination coefficients exceeding 0.99. Recoveries were assessed at three levels using spiked samples, ranging from 75.6% to 115.8%, with relative standard deviations between 0.8% and 9.7%. This method was successfully applied to determine 14 sex hormones in botanical dietary supplements. Progesterone was detected in one sample at a concentration of 64 µg·kg<sup>-1</sup>. The SUPRAS method coupled with HPLC-MS/MS, was proved to be efficient, easy-to-operate, and sensitive for determining sex hormones in botanical dietary supplements.
40050030	Field-evolved resistance in Phthorimaea absoluta to abamectin: genetic foundations, female-linked traits, and cross-resistance pattern.	Phthorimaea absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) poses a significant challenge in tomato cultivation owing to its increasing resistance to various insecticide classes. This study aimed to characterize the resistance of a field-collected P. absoluta population to abamectin, focusing on its genetic aspects and cross-resistance with other chemical groups, and monitoring the frequency of resistance in other populations.
40050013	Evaluating the biocontrol potential and whole genome sequencing of Pseudomonas fluorescens HT1: a promising agent against southern blight in Coptis chinensis.	Southern blight, caused by Sclerotium rolfsii, poses a formidable threat to the cultivation of Coptis chinensis, especially affecting both yield and crop quality. Given the environmental harm associated with chemical fungicides, microbial antagonists are emerging as a viable solution for plant disease management. This study aimed to identify bacterial strains with antagonistic properties against southern blight in Coptis chinensis and to evaluate their biocontrol capabilities.
40049996	Monitoring of resistance or susceptibility of Amblyomma mixtum (Acari: Ixodidae) to synthetic acaricides from Mexico.	In Mexico, a substantial challenge within cattle industry pertains to the widespread occurrence of Rhipicephalus microplus and Amblyomma mixtum infestation. Various acaricides compounds have been developed to manage these ticks infestation; however, their improper and frequent application has contributed to the emergence of resistant tick strains. However, there is a paucity of data specifically regarding the acaricide resistance status of A. mixtum. For this reason, the aim of this study was to monitor the susceptibility or resistance of A. mixtum to principal synthetic chemical acaricides used in control programme of A.mixtum and identify potential risk factors associated with A. mixtum resistant to ixodicides. Fully engorged adult female A. mixtum ticks were collected from cattle in twenty ranches. Larval packet test (LPT) and larval immersion test (LIT) were performed using discriminating doses (d.d) of ixodicides. The formulations tested were a Phenylpyrazole (fipronil), Organophosphates (coumaphos), Formamidine (amitraz) Synthetic Pyrethroids (cypermethrin) and Macrocyclic Lactones (ivermectin). The resulting phenotype was categorized as either resistant, probable resistant, or susceptible. A strain of A. mixtum collected from a cattle farm in the municipality of Las Choapas exhibited resistance to multiple acaricides, demonstrating diverse mortality levels at the d.d: fipronil (65.3 %), coumaphos (54.3 %), amitraz (52.4 %), and cypermethrin (35.5 %); except for ivermectin, where probable resistance was observed (90.8 %). A total of 50 % (10/20) of A. mixtum strains collected were resistant at least one acaricide evaluated. Furthermore, the strains of A. mixtum evaluated showed a higher frequency of resistance to amitraz. Also, only three strains assessed were susceptible to all acaricides tested. This crucial information will refine strategies for the effective control of ectoparasites.
40049910	Saponins in soil, their degradation and effect on soil enzymatic activities.	Saponins can be potential candidates for the development of safe biopesticides, due to their widely acknowledged insecticidal, fungicidal and nematicidal activity, but information on their effects on soil biological properties is still limited. This study aimed to investigate the short-term fate of saponins from Medicago sativa in soil and their dose-effect relationship with microbial biomass and selected enzyme activities in soils with different origin, physical and chemical properties. Microbial degradation of total saponins ranged from 46 % to 91 %, according to soil characteristics, within 28 days from their incorporation into the soil. Both saponin glycosidic chains and triterpenic aglycones were also microbially degraded, though by dynamics changing among the different soils. In all soils, M. sativa saponins significantly reduced microbial biomass at rates of 10 and 20 mg saponin mixture per g of soil. Microbial enzymatic activities were less affected as indicating an adaptive response of soil microbial communities to the presence of saponins.
40049501	pH-responsive nanoparticles for oral delivery of RNAi for sustained protection against Spodoptera exigua.	To enhance the RNAi efficiency of dsRNA against the Spodoptera exigua through a feeding method, we developed a pH-responsive nanoparticle, chitosan-polyethylene glycol-carboxyl (CS-PEG-COOH). This nanoparticle enhances RNAi efficiency by improving dsRNA stability in the midgut of S. exigua and can intelligently release dsRNA under alkaline conditions. Firstly, the CS-PEG-COOH carrier was prepared via cross-linking reactions, and the mass ratio of dsRNA to CS-PEG-COOH was obtained using electrophoretic mobility. The carrier composite materials were then characterized using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Zeta potential analysis. The stability and delivery efficiency of the dsRNA/CS-PEG-COOH complex were then verified using electrophoretic mobility and fluorescence labeling methods. Finally, the RNAi efficiency and synergistic mechanism of the complex were analyzed using feeding methods and RNA-seq. The results show that CS-PEG-COOH (40.16 nm size, + 6.44 mV charge) forms a clustered complex with dsRNA through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. CS-PEG-COOH significantly enhancing the stability and delivery efficiency of dsRNA in the midgut of S. exigua. Additionally, at pH > 8, dsRNA could be released from dsRNA/CS-PEG-COOH. The RNAi results showed that, dsRNA/CS-PEG-COOH could effectively inhibit the expression of the Acetylcholinesterase (Ace1 + Ace2) gene (65 %), and led to significantly increase mortality (51.82 %), a prolonged developmental period (25 %) and reduced egg production (22.02 %). The physiological and molecular synergistic mechanisms were revealed by RNA-seq analysis. The CS-PEG-COOH-loaded dsACE1 + dsACE2 led to down-regulation of genes related to drug metabolism, hormone synthesis, and stratum corneum biosynthesis, which inhibited insect growth and development. Overall, We developed an appropriate delivery method for dsRNA application in Lepidoptera, providing a basis for developing RNA pesticides with high efficiency and environmental safety.
40049439	Chlorpyrifos-oxon results in autophagic flux dysfunction contributing to neuronal apoptosis via a ROS/AMPK/CHOP activation pathway.	Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used organophosphate (OP) pesticide in agriculture and sanitation, known to elicit neurotoxic effects. Chlorpyrifos-oxon (CPO), a metabolite of CPF, is the primary neurotoxic agent, yet its mechanisms are less understood. In this study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of CPO-induced neurotoxicity. CPO exposure significantly induced cytotoxicity in Neuro-2a cells, alongside the activation of apoptosis, as evidenced by an increase in the apoptotic cell population, caspase-3 activity, and cleavage of caspaspe-3, -7, and PARP proteins. Furthermore, defective autophagy was observed in CPO-treated Neuro-2a cells, indicated by increased expression of Beclin-1, Atg5, LC3-II, and p62 proteins. 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, suppressed CPO-activated LC3-II and apoptotic marker proteins expression, but not p62. In contrast, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1, autophagic flux inhibitors, potentiated the CPO-induced elevation of LC3-II, p62, and cleaved caspase-3 and -7 protein levels. CPO exposure also upregulated CHOP protein expression. Transfection with CHOP-specific siRNA markedly reduced CHOP protein expression, autophagic flux dysfunction, and apoptosis. Additionally, CPO exposure significantly increased AMPKα phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), but not the AMPK inhibitor Compound C, effectively attenuated the CPO-induced ROS generation in neuronal cells, which was accompanied by the prevention of AMPKα activation, downstream CHOP expression, autophagic flux dysfunction, and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that CPO-induced neurotoxicity arises from autophagic flux dysfunction, contributing to apoptosis via the ROS-activated AMPK pathway, which regulates CHOP expression, ultimately leading to neuronal cell death. Targeting the ROS/AMPK/CHOP axis may offer a promising intervention to against CPO-induced neurotoxicity.
40049387	Interpretable machine learning unveils key predictors and default values in an expanded database of human in vitro dermal absorption studies with pesticides.	The skin is the main route of exposure to plant protection products for operators, workers, residents, and bystanders. Assessing dermal absorption is key for evaluating pesticide exposure. The initial approach to risk assessment involves using default dermal absorption values or applying read-across data from experimental results from different formulations. In this way, to support non-dietary pesticide risk assessment focused but not limited to Brazil, this project evaluated 759 GLP-compliant in vitro human skin dermal absorption studies covering 25 formulation types and 248 active substances at multiple concentrations using interpretable machine learning techniques. Bayesian Additive Regression Trees - BART method indicated that Log Pow and molecular weight have the highest importance when predicting dermal absorption; both parameters exhibit moderate interaction uncertainty within each other and with formulation groups water-based and organic-solvent based and with tested form (concentrates or dilutions). The default values for each formulation group were determined using the upper bound of a non-parametric confidence interval for a specified quantile, with calculations conducted via bootstrapping methods; the proposed values correspond to the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the 95th percentile: for concentrates, 10% for organic-solvent based, 4% for water-based and 3% for solid formulations. For dilutions, 42% for organic-solvent based, 37% for water-based and 39% for solid formulations. Organic-solvent based dermal absorption values from experimental data can be used as conservative surrogates for solid and water-based formulations. When no experimental data is available for higher spray dilutions of a given formulation type, a pro-rated correction is proposed to a 2 to 5-fold concentration difference, limited to the respective formulation group default value.
40049307	Contaminant-driven midgut histological damage in bees and other aculeate Hymenoptera: A quantitative review.	We present a review about histological sub-lethal effects due to anthropogenic contaminants on the midgut of bees and other aculeate hymenopterans. Contaminant types, damage types, and methodology were extracted and summarized from 74 published articles, and then quantitatively analyzed. We found that the Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) is by far the most widely used model. Contaminants have largely been tested under laboratory conditions, particularly insecticides and fungicides. Tissue-level damage (e.g., degradation of epithelium and of peritrophic membrane) were often detected together with cell-level damage (e.g., cell vacuolisation, karyorrhexis). Descriptive statistics and mixed models suggested that herbicides may cause a specific mix of alterations with an overall lower severity compared with other pesticides, while the combined use of light and electron microscopy seemed to detect more damage types. We claim for efforts to reduce biases in future studies on such histological effects, allowing their clearer use as markers of human activities.
40049250	Is there a link between exposure to pesticides and antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria isolated from Thai farmers?	The organophosphate pesticides have the potential to impact microbial diversity, but their influence on antibiotic resistance (AR) in bacteria remains understudied.
40049237	Antisense DNA acaricide targeting pre-rRNA of two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae as efficacy-enhancing agent of fungus Metarhizium robertsii.	Two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the most dangerous pests in the world and one of the most pesticide-resistant species ever. Complex biological preparations are of great interest for the acaricide market because they do not poison ecosystems and do not bioaccumulate in food products, simultaneously, pests more slowly develop resistance to complex preparations. In this study we applied complex bioformulation composed of 11-mer antisense oligonucleotide (oligonucleotide acaricide or DNA acaricide) Tur-3 and fungus Metarhizium robertsii for T. urticae control. We discovered that joint contact application of DNA acaricide and fungus M. robertsii significantly attenuates reproduction rate of the mite. Our results indicate that DNA acaricide Tur-3 and fungus M. robertsii act synergistically and lead to a significant 7-times elevated mortality rate and a reduction of 80% in the mite fecundity. Oligonucleotide acaricide Tur-3 causes 2.5-fold reduction of expression of the target pre-rRNA of T. urticae and suppresses the activity of key players of detoxifying enzymes of its defense system (phenoloxidase, esterase, glutathione-S-transferase), on average, by 2-3 fold. Oligonucleotide acaricide Tur-3 interferes with protein biosynthesis causing decrease in production of defense system enzymes of the pest. Obviously, attenuation of defense system enhances fungal infection or/and fungus produces a variety of enzymes that degrade the integument structure of the pest, aiding the penetration of oligonucleotide acaricide Tur-3. This research article is the first evidence of successful application of oligonucleotide acaricide together with fungus M. robertsii for efficient T. urticae control. Combined application of oligonucleotide acaricides based on conservative antisense sequences of rDNAs of pests and fungi is a potent and selective approach for eco-friendly plant protection.
40049114	Comprehensive ecological risk assessment method for multi-pesticide pollution in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, China.	Pesticide residues and their accumulation in marine environments pose potential threats to the ecosystem balance and human health. Assessment of pesticide residue levels and ecological risks in marine waters is insufficient. Therefore, we conducted a quantitative analysis of four different categories of pesticides in the surface waters of the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea in China. A comprehensive ecological risk assessment framework was constructed based on the importance of ecosystem services, utilizing the risk quotient (RQ) and entropy weighting methods to evaluate the multi-pesticide ecological risks in the study area. Thirteen pesticides were detected in the surface waters, with total concentration levels ranging from 8.18 to 80.60 ng/L, and the herbicide Atrazine and insecticide Imidacloprid were found at the highest levels. Concentration levels were higher in the Bohai Sea than in the Yellow Sea, and the highest area was mainly located on the coast of Shandong Province, China. The ecological risk of multi-pesticide pollution was the highest in the coastal regions of Shandong and was associated with Atrazine and Acetamiprid. Source analysis suggested that triazine herbicide and neonicotinoid insecticides are predominantly land-sourced, whereas sulfonylurea herbicides are primarily atmospheric. This study provides valuable support for formulating relevant environmental protection policies and measures.
40048801	A progress report in advancements of heterocyclic compounds as novel antimalarial agents over the last 5 years.	Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, remains a significant global health challenge, especially in tropical and subtropical regions where the disease is endemic. The complex Plasmodium lifecycle, involving stages in both the liver and bloodstream, leads to symptoms such as high fever, anemia, and, in severe cases, life-threatening complications, particularly P. falciparum infections. While historical treatments such as quinine and modern therapies such as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been effective, the growing issue of drug and insecticide resistance undermines these efforts. This resistance has spurred the need for new antimalarial drugs and strategies. Among the promising areas of research are heterocyclic compounds, which, due to their diverse and versatile chemical structures, are being investigated for their ability to disrupt the Plasmodium lifecycle. These compounds have potential as novel therapeutic agents that could enhance current treatment options. Understanding the mechanisms underlying drug resistance and advancing these therapeutic innovations are crucial for maintaining effective malaria control and treatment, highlighting the importance of on-going research in this field.
40048645	Counterion Lewis Acidity Determines the Rate of Hexafluorophosphate Hydrolysis in Nonaqueous Battery Electrolytes.	The decomposition of LiPF<sub>6</sub> in nonaqueous battery electrolytes is a well-studied, deleterious process that leads to hydrofluoric acid (HF) driven transition metal dissolution at the positive electrode and gas production (H<sub>2</sub>) at the anode, often attributed to the inherent moisture sensitivity of the hexafluorophosphate anion. In this work, we use in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to demonstrate that the rate of PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup> hydrolysis significantly decreases in Na and K systems, where the Lewis acidity of the cation dictates the rate of decomposition according to Li<sup>+</sup> > Na<sup>+</sup> > K<sup>+</sup>. Despite the remarkable stability of Na and K electrolytes, we show that they are still susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of protons, which can catalyze the breakdown of PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup>, indicating that these chemistries are not immune from decomposition when paired with solvent/cathode combinations that generate H<sup>+</sup> at high voltage. Quantitative in situ multinuclear and multidimensional NMR of decomposed electrolytes shows that after long-term degradation, these systems contain HF, HPO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>F as well as a variety of defluorinated byproducts, such as organophosphates and phosphonates, that are structurally similar to herbicides/insecticides and may pose health and environmental risks. Taken together, these results have important implications for Na- and K-ion batteries where hazardous and harmful byproducts like HF, soluble transition metals, organophosphates, and phosphonates can be greatly reduced through cell design. Our results also suggest that next-generation chemistries present a pathway to safer batteries that contain lower quantities of flammable gases, like H<sub>2</sub>, if properly engineered.
40048640	Design, Synthesis, and Herbicidal Activity of Biaryl-Pyridazinone/Phthalimide Derivatives as Novel Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase Inhibitors.	In this study, a series of biaryl-pyridazinone/phthalimide derivatives were designed and synthesized as novel protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) inhibitors. Herbicidal activity and crop safety assessments revealed that some compounds exhibited excellent herbicidal activity and crop safety profiles. For instance, at 37.5 g ai/ha, compound <b>7m</b> inhibited <i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i> (<i>AR</i>), <i>Abutilon theophrasti</i> (<i>AT</i>), <i>Medicago sativa</i> (<i>MS</i>), <i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i> (<i>EC</i>), and <i>Digitaria sanguinalis</i> (<i>DS</i>) with 90% to 100% efficacy, comparable to the commercial herbicide saflufenacil (SAF). Compound <b>7m</b> still showed effective weed control against the test broadleaf weeds at a lower dose of 9.375 g ai/ha. Additionally, <b>7m</b> demonstrated excellent safety for wheat and corn at dosages up to 150 g ai/ha. <i>In vitro</i> experiments revealed that the representative compounds exhibited significant inhibitory activity against <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> PPO (<i>At</i>PPO). Molecular docking of <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> PPO (<i>Nt</i>PPO) and <b>7m</b> showed significant hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and π-alkyl interactions between <b>7m</b> and residues, such as Cys-177, Thr-176, Arg-98, Phe-392, and Leu-372. Furthermore, <b>7m</b> caused a notable reduction in chlorophyll (Chl) content in weeds. <b>7m</b> is a promising candidate for the development of novel herbicides.
40048639	Chemical targeting of prolyl-tRNA synthetase stalls ovarian development and kills malaria vectors.	Along with rising resistance to antimalarials, the emergence of insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquito species also remains a serious concern. Here, we reveal two potent compounds that show larvicidal and endectocidal activity against malaria vectors, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi, respectively.
40048438	Akt3 links mitochondrial function to the regulation of Aurora B and mitotic fidelity.	Akt3 is a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis in the endothelium. Akt3 depletion results in mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased mitochondrial biogenesis, and decreased angiogenesis. Here we link mitochondrial homeostasis with mitotic fidelity-depletion of Akt3 results in the missegregation of chromosomes as visualized by multinucleation and micronuclei formation. We have connected Akt3 to Aurora B, a significant player in chromosome segregation. Akt3 localizes to the nucleus, where it associates with and regulates WDR12. During mitosis, WDR12 is localized to the dividing chromosomes, and its depletion results in a similar mitotic phenotype to Akt3 depletion. WDR12 associates with Aurora B, both of which are downregulated under conditions of Akt3 depletion. We used the model oxidant paraquat to induce mitochondrial dysfunction to test whether the Akt3-dependent effect on mitochondrial homeostasis is linked to mitotic function. Paraquat treatment also causes chromosome missegregation by inhibiting the expression of Akt3, WDR12, and Aurora B. The inhibition of ROS rescued both the mitotic fidelity and the expression of Akt3 and Aurora B. Akt3 directly phosphorylates the major nuclear export protein CRM-1, causing an increase in its expression, resulting in the inhibition of PGC-1 nuclear localization, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. The Akt3/Aurora B pathway is also dependent on CRM-1. CRM-1 overexpression resulted in chromosome missegregation and downregulation of Aurora B similar to that of Akt3 depletion. Akt3 null hearts at midgestation (E14.5), a stage in which proliferation is occurring, have decreased Aurora B expression, increased CRM-1 expression, decreased proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Akt3 null hearts are smaller and have a thinner compact cell layer than age-matched wild-type mice. Akt3 null tissue has dysmorphic nuclear structures, suggesting mitotic catastrophe. Our findings show that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by paraquat or Akt3 depletion results in a CRM-1-dependent disruption of Aurora B and mitotic fidelity.
40047941	Beyond the pink: uncovering the secrets of pink pigmented facultative methylotrophs.	Pink Pigmented Facultative Methylotrophs (PPFMs) belong to a diverse group of methylotrophic bacteria predominantly in the genus Methylobacterium, and are known for their beneficial interactions with plants. They can use single-carbon compounds, such as methanol, formate, formaldehyde and methyl amines as well as various multi-carbon substrates as sources of carbon and energy. PPFMs are characterized by their distinctive pink pigmentation and are commonly found in the phyllosphere, where they play a major role in promoting plant growth through various mechanisms; These mechanisms include the production of phytohormones, enhancing nutrient acquisition, mitigating abiotic stresses and providing biocontrol of phytopathogens. Due to their eco-friendly nature PPFMs are viewed as promising alternatives to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in green agriculture. Furthermore, the ecological significance of PPFMs extends beyond their direct interactions with host plants. They also contribute to the resilience of ecosystems by participating in the cycling of nutrients in the environment. As the importance of the plant microbiome in agriculture becomes more recognized, the potential of PPFMs to support sustainable farming practices and contribute to environmental health is increasingly evident. This underscores their relevance in addressing global agricultural challenges.
40047596	Modeling the Reaction Process for the Synthesis of Ethyl Chrysanthemate from Ethyl Diazoacetate in a Micro-Flow Platform.	Ethyl diazoacetate can react with 2,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexadiene to yield ethyl chrysanthemumate, an important raw material for synthesizing various pesticides. In conventional conditions, this cyclopropanation process suffers from low efficiency and yield due to ethyl diazoacetate. This demands more understanding of the catalytic process from the mechanism and modeling to find a solution. In this work, we set up a micro-flow platform to carefully study the kinetic characteristics of the cyclopropanation reaction of ethyl diazoacetate catalyzed by a complex of copper stearate and phenylhydrazine. Through a reasonable simplification of the reaction network, we established a reaction kinetic model with good prediction capacity within a wide range of operating conditions. It provides a basis for guiding the development of efficient conversion processes and condition optimization.
40047355	Ultrabithorax regulates Leptinotarsa decemlineata wing development along with insulin and ecdysteroid signaling pathways.	Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Colorado potato beetle, CPB) is a notorious pest of potatoes. Its hardened forewings, known as elytra, protect the hindwings and the abdomen against enemies and chemical pesticides. Ubx plays a crucial role in differentiating insect wings, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Our research showed that Ubx is highly expressed in the T3 thoracic segment (T3) and appendages, while Ubx is absent in the forewings. RNA interference for Ubx resulted in the dorsal plate of the T3 being shifted toward the T2, hindwings were sheathed from the membranous in adults, and forewings were curling. The hindwing development-related genes downstream of Ubx, including LdDpp, LdIro, LdVg, LdWg, and LdASH, were significantly up-regulated in Ubx-inhibited insects compared with the control, by 2.40, 1.88, 1.81, 1.89, and 2.81 times, respectively. After feeding 20-hydrosyecdysone (20E), the forewing was flatter and more stretched than the control, leading to increased wing area, which indicates Ubx regulation is associated with the feedback of ecdysteroids. The expression levels of 3 ecdysteroid receptor genes EcR, EcRA, and EcRB were significantly lower in knocking down LdUbx insects than the control and was able to be recovered by 20E feeding, suggesting that ecdysteroid is associated with LdUbx-regulated wing development. Cosilencing LdUbx and LdAkt genes significantly inhibited the growth of forewings and hindwings, reducing the area of the wings. Together, our findings suggested that LdUbx regulates wing development along with ecdysteroid and insulin-like peptide signaling pathways, which provides a novel molecular mechanism of wing development and differentiation in insects.
40047252	Comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomics and metabolomics reveal the changes induced by nano-selenium and melatonin in Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. Huizao.	Jujube (Zizyphus jujuba), belonging to the Rhamnaceae, contains various bioactive components including flavonoids and polysaccharides. In our previous study, jujube quality was improved by application of nano-selenium (Nano-Se) and melatonin; however, little research has been conducted on the induced molecular mechanisms. Zizyphus jujuba cv. Huizao was used as experimental materials to compare and analyze the transcriptomics and metabolomics mechanisms.
40047200	Computational Molecular Docking Analysis of Linalool Enantiomers Interaction With Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1 (MAPK1): Insights Into Potential Binding Mechanisms and Affinity.	Molecular docking analysis of linalool interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) provides valuable insights into the potential binding mechanisms and affinity of this interaction. Linalool, a naturally occurring terpene alcohol, has been the subject of increasing interest due to its diverse pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. MAPK1 is a crucial signaling protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Using MOE software, we conducted a stereoisomer analysis of (R)- and (S)-linalool in our study. After docking, the ligand was ranked according to their binding energy and the best lead compound was selected based on the highest binding energy. The results showed that the S-linalool isomer showed superior anticancer activity, while the R-linalool molecule showed less activity. This interaction could provide insights into linalool's potential therapeutic applications, highlighting its diverse pharmacological properties.

40046651	Sustainable control of the bird cherry-oat aphid (<i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> L.) in northwestern Ontario using <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> delivered by bumblebees.	<i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> is one of the main vectors of barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), which affects the grain yield of oats. Several biological control strategies have been studied to control this pest, one of which is Bee Vectoring Technology (BVT) using bumblebees. We tested the efficacy of <i>Beauveria bassiana</i>, as vectored by bumblebees, and a direct spray application of neem (a natural bio-insecticide derived from the <i>Azadirachta indica</i> tree) on aphids. An assessment of the pest's impact on the plots surveyed in northwestern Ontario revealed incidence rates of 80%. The use of bumblebees as a dispersal agent of <i>B. bassiana</i> significantly reduced the aphid population (0.542 ± 0.147b) compared to the untreated control (0.125 ± 0.069a). The application of diluted neem also showed a reduction in the aphid population (0.708 ± 0.221a). Although the products used controlled the pests, they had no effect on the aphid's natural enemy, the ladybug. Therefore, the dissemination of <i>B. bassiana</i> by the bumblebee <i>Bombus impatiens</i> leads to a decrease in the vector <i>Rhopalosiphum padi</i> population and consequently reduces the severity of barley yellow dwarf disease in oat fields.
40045945	Understanding interactive effects between habitat configuration and pesticide use for pollination: towards better informed landscape management.	The restoration of natural landscape elements is a frequently adopted pathway to improve wild pollinator abundance, diversity, and their pollination services in intensively used agricultural landscapes. However, pollinators in the intended refuges can become exposed to agrochemicals when foraging in surrounding agricultural fields. In order to effectively design pollinator conservation measures such as habitat restoration or pesticide reduction schemes, the effect of land use configuration on pesticide exposure and pollination service requires further investigation.
40045889	Engineered Polymeric Microspheres with Synergistic Hydrogen-Bonding Nanotraps and Multisite Adsorption for Ultrafast Herbicide Decontamination.	The ultrafast removal of trace herbicides like paraquat (PQ) and diquat (DQ) from water is urgent yet challenging due to their highwater stability and strong-binding properties. Here, efficient PQ and DQ removal based on hydrogen-bonding nanotraps dominant multisite adsorption were developed. Two crosslinked polymeric microspheres, βCD-PF and γCD-PF, were synthesized from cyclodextrins (CDs) and hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene (HFP). The γCD-PF microsphere with sufficient hydrogen-bonding nanotraps on the pore surface prompts adsorption kinetics constants of PQ and DQ up to 127.09 and 192.64 g mg<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, achieving 99% removal efficiency for PQ and DQ within 5 s. γCD-PF exhibits exceptional selectivity for PQ and DQ over larger competing dyes. Importantly, trace PQ (1 ppm) can be effectively treated with γCD-PF to achieve a concentration far below the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard (0.003 ppm) within 30 s. The ultrafast adsorption is driven by a multisite mechanism: electrostatic and π-π interactions from HFP promote adsorbate accumulation on the CD surface, while the high-density hydrogen-bonding nanotraps in γCD-PF enhance hydrogen bond strength, enabling rapid capture. This work provides a valuable strategy for designing ultrafast adsorbents for effective herbicide removal from water.
40045847	Copper-Mediated Direct Trifluoromethylation of Trichloromethyl Alkanes.	CF<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>2</sub>-containing compounds are of significant synthetic value but are typically synthesized from environmentally harmful hydrochlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Herein, we report the use of a well-defined Cu(I) complex, [(bpy)Cu(CF<sub>3</sub>)], as an efficient trifluoromethylating reagent for the direct trifluoromethylation of trichloroalkanes under mild conditions, affording CF<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>2</sub>-containing products with excellent chemoselectivity. This protocol also enabled the gram-scale synthesis of cyhalothric acid ester, which is a key intermediate in the production of pyrethroid pesticides.
40045824	Nanoparticles alter locust development and behaviour.	Locusts, among the world's most destructive migratory pests, threaten food security by devastating crops and pastures. Conventional chemical insecticides pose environmental and health risks, highlighting the need for sustainable alternatives. We demonstrate the efficacy of nickel ferrite (NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles (36 ± 10 nm), as a safe, cost-effective insecticide for locust management. These NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles disrupt locust development by impairing blastokinesis and growth, thus resulting in malformed nymphs with compacted abdomens and disorganised body structures - primarily arising from significantly lower heart rates (30 bpm for control <i>vs.</i> 20 bpm for embryos exposed to NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and changes to end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions. Adult locusts retained ingested nanoparticles in their coelomic cavities, which could potentially be used as traceable markers for swarm tracking. Additionally, the nanoparticles were recoverable from soil with over 90% efficiency, minimising potential ecological impact. Our research therefore offers an innovative nanotechnology-based solution for sustainable and effective locust management.
40045648	[Determination of cycloxaprid and paichongding residues in foods of plant origin by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].	Neonicotinoid insecticides play an important role in the prevention and control of pests in crops, such as rice, wheat, corn, and vegetables, because of their broad spectrum, high efficiency, low toxicity, and low residue formation. However, their widespread use poses potential threats to the environment and human health. Cycloxaprid and paichongding are two new classes of neonicotinoid insecticides. The National Food Safety Standard Maximum Residue Limits for Pesticides in Foods (GB 2763) specifies the maximum residue limits for paichongding and cycloxaprid in rice, brown rice, wheat, and cabbage. However, the established limits are only temporary. In addition, no detection standards have yet been specified, and no relevant standards have been established in China. Therefore, establishing a method for analyzing cycloxaprid and paichongding residues in food is of particular importance. In this study, an optimized method was established to determine the residues of cycloxaprid and two noncorresponding isomers of paichongding in plant foods using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The chromatographic conditions, matrix extraction methods for dried fruits and tea, and amounts of the purification materials C<sub>18</sub>, PSA, GCB, and anhydrous magnesium sulfate were optimized. The pesticides were extracted using an acetonitrile solution and separated from water with the addition of sodium chloride. The samples were centrifuged at 5000 r/min for 5 min, after which 1.00 mL of the supernatant was purified using 150 mg of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, 25 mg of C<sub>18</sub>, 25 mg of PSA, and 10 mg of GCB. Cycloxaprid and paichongding were separated on a ACQUITY UPLC BEH C<sub>18</sub> chromatographic column (100 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) via gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution containing 5 mmol/L ammonium formate-acetonitrile as the mobile phase, and detected in electrospray positive ionization mode coupled with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Quantitative analysis was performed using an external standard method. Cycloxaprid and paichongding demonstrated good linear relationships within their respective concentration ranges, and the corresponding correlation coefficients were all above 0.99. The limits of detection (<i>S/N</i>=3) and quantification were 0.05 μg/kg and 0.01 mg/kg, respectively, which meet the requirements specified in GB 2763-2021 and GB 2763.1-2022. The established method was used to validate the recoveries of cycloxaprid and paichongding spiked in foods of plant origin, such as paddy, brown rice, wheat, rice, peanut, raisin, cabbage, lettuce, green bean, tomato, potato, shiitake mushroom, apple, citrus, and tea substrates, at three levels. The spiked levels covered the limit levels specified in GB 2763-2021 and GB 2763.1-2022. The mean recoveries of the target substances added to the 15 substrates at concentrations of 1, 2, and 10 times the LOQ or the limit values specified in GB 2763-2021 and GB 2763.1-2022 were distributed between 78% and 110%, and the RSDs were within the range of 0-12.8%. One hundred batches of fruit and vegetable samples were analyzed using the developed method, and the results showed that the selected samples were not contaminated with either cycloxaprid or paichongding. The proposed method is simple, sensitive, and universal, and has wide coverage. Thus, it can be used as a confirmatory and quantitative detection method for epoxidine and piperidine in foods of plant origin.
40045385	Morphofunctional characteristics of flight-related traits in deltamethrin-resistant and susceptible Triatoma infestans (Klug, 1834) of the Argentinean Chaco.	Chagas disease, transmitted by triatomine bugs, is a major vector-borne parasitic disease in Latin America. Triatoma infestans, the principal vector in the Southern Cone, is primarily controlled through residual insecticide spraying. However, resistance to pyrethroids, especially in Northern Argentina and Southern Bolivia, has emerged. Resistant T. infestans populations exhibit reduced fitness, including impacts on reproductive success and dispersal capacity. This study investigates the flight potential and morphological changes in T. infestans populations with varying levels of insecticide resistance, hypothesizing that resistance may induce morphological changes in wing and head structures related to dispersal.
40045377	Prevalence and determinants of insecticide-treated net ownership among women of reproductive age in Nigeria: a mixed-effect insight from the 2021 malaria indicator survey.	Malaria continues to be a significant public health issue in Nigeria, which bears the highest burden of the disease globally. This study examined the prevalence and determinants of insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership among women of reproductive age in Nigeria.
40045023	Genomic and morphological features of an Amazonian Bacillus thuringiensis with mosquito larvicidal activity.	The occurrence of mosquito-borne diseases is increasing, and their geographical range is expanding due to climate change. New control measures are urgently needed to combat these debilitating and, in some cases, fatal diseases. Bacteria of the genus Bacillus are of interest due to the production of bioactive compounds, including those useful for insect control. The discovery and characterization of new species of Bacillus with mosquito larvicidal activity may offer opportunities to develop new products for vector control. In this study, we evaluated larvicidal activity, described morphological characteristics, and sequenced and analyzed the genome of a bacterial strain (GD02.13) isolated from the Amazon region. The metabolites produced by GD02.13 are as effective in killing Aedes aegypti larvae as the commercial product Natular™ DT (Spinosad). Furthermore, the morphological characteristics of the GD02.13 spores and crystal inclusions resemble those previously described for B. thuringiensis. A phylogenetic analysis based on 443 single-copy orthologs indicated that the bacterial strain GD02.13 belongs to the Bacillus thuringiensis species. Its genome, which was assembled and has a size of 6.6 Mb, contains 16 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and genes encoding insecticidal proteins, predicted based on sequence similarity. The data obtained in this study support the development of new insecticide products based on the strain GD02.13 of B. thuringiensis.
40044941	Structural basis for the activation of plant bunyavirus replication machinery and its dual-targeted inhibition by ribavirin.	Despite the discovery of plant viruses as a new class of pathogens over a century ago, the structure of plant virus replication machinery and antiviral pesticide remains lacking. Here we report five cryogenic electron microscopy structures of a ~330-kDa RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from a devastating plant bunyavirus, tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus (TSWV), including the apo, viral-RNA-bound, base analogue ribavirin-bound and ribavirin-triphosphate-bound states. They reveal that a flexible loop of RdRp's motif F functions as 'sensor' to perceive viral RNA and further acts as an 'adaptor' to promote the formation of a complete catalytic centre. A ten-base RNA 'hook' structure is sufficient to trigger major conformational changes and activate RdRp. Chemical screening showed that ribavirin is effective against TSWV, and structural data revealed that ribavirin disrupts both hook-binding and catalytic core formation, locking polymerase in its inactive state. This work provides structural insights into the mechanisms of plant bunyavirus RdRp activation and its dual-targeted site inhibition, facilitating the development of pesticides against plant viruses.
40044912	Valorization of Agricultural Residues to Valuable Products: A Circular Bioeconomy Approach.	Intensive agricultural production generates a lot of residues yearly, exhausting and depleting the soils and accumulating pesticides and mineral fertilizers. Although introducing the no-till technologies is related to the reduction of tillage, leaving most of the plant residues on the field and decreasing fertigation, the global crop residues are estimated to be 2800 million tons per year. They could be successfully utilized via several approaches integrated into the circular bioeconomy concept. Thus, stopping the existing vicious circle of digging most of the primary materials such as fossil fuels, the vast application of chemical fertilizers, gaining increased or restored biodiversity, capturing CO<sub>2</sub> into the soils and enhancing the organic content, having cleaner underground waters, soils and crop production, and finally improved quality of life. The transformation of these residues into value-added products faces various technological and commercialization difficulties that limit their fuller utilization. In the present chapter, we aim to describe the production of agricultural residues in the EU and present their properties and technologies for biological valorization. In addition, the potential risks associated with the micro- and nano-plastics content of agricultural residues are discussed.
40044609	Disease epidemics and species interactions: A manipulation of seasonal establishment of fungal diseases in an old field.	Many disease epidemics recur seasonally, and such seasonal epidemics can be shaped by species interactions among parasites, pathogens, or other microbes. Field experiments are a classic approach for understanding species interactions but are rarely used to study seasonal epidemics. Our research objective was to help fill this gap by manipulating the seasonal timing of the establishment of infectious diseases while tracking epidemics and other ecological responses. To do this, we conducted a multiyear field experiment in an old field in the Piedmont of North Carolina, USA, dominated by the grass species tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb). Darbysh). In the field, tall fescue experienced seasonal epidemics of multiple foliar fungal diseases: anthracnose in spring, brown patch in mid-summer, and crown rust in late summer to fall. In a fully randomized design, we applied four fungicide treatments to replicate plots of intact vegetation in specific seasons to manipulate the timing of disease epidemics. One treatment was designed to delay the establishment of anthracnose until mid-summer, and another to delay the establishment of both anthracnose and brown patch until fall. In a third treatment, fungicide was applied year-round, and, in a fourth treatment, fungicide was never applied. The experiment comprised 64 plots, each 2 m × 2 m, surveyed from May 2017 to February 2020. Here, we report a dataset documenting responses in the community structure of both plants and foliar fungi. To track disease prevalence in the host population across seasons and years, this dataset includes monthly leaf-level observations of the disease status of over 100,000 leaves. To quantify transmission and investigate within-host pathogen interactions, we longitudinally surveyed disease status in host individuals of known age at least weekly over two growing seasons. Finally, the dataset includes annual data on infection prevalence of the systemic fungal endophyte Epichloë coenophiala, community-level aboveground plant biomass, and plant community cover. These data can be used for meta-analyses, comparisons, and syntheses across systems as ecologists seek to predict and mechanistically understand seasonal disease epidemics. There are no copyrights on the dataset, and we request that users of this dataset cite this paper in all publications resulting from its use.
40044425	Toxic effects of eight azole fungicides on the growth, photosynthetic activity, and oxidative stress of Raphidocelis subcapitata.	This study investigates the 96 hr toxicity and physiological effects of eight azole fungicides on Raphidocelis subcapitata (R. subcapitata). The findings revealed significant differences in toxicity levels among these fungicides, with the hierarchy of toxicity as follows: difenoconazole ≈ tetraconazole ≈ fuberidazole > metconazole > terrazole ≈ triflumizole > flutriafol > hymexazol. Increased concentrations of azole fungicides corresponded with decreased cellular activity and inhibited algal growth, highlighting the concentration-dependent nature of toxicity. The toxicological mechanisms involved include reduced levels of chlorophyll (Chla, Chlb) and carotenoids, disrupting the photosynthetic process. Additionally, exposure to these fungicides resulted in decreased total protein levels, increased reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and elevated activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. Consequently, there was a significant rise in apoptosis rates among algal cells. These findings provide important insights for assessing the ecological impact of azole fungicides on aquatic ecosystems and aquatic life.

40044155	[Production and biological activity of the triazine derivatives: focusing on antibiotics produced by bacteria].	Heterocyclic triazines and their derivatives have excellent biological activity and have been used as herbicides and anticancer drugs. A large number of derivatives were synthesized and their biological activity was investigated. Some bacteria synthesize the triazine derivatives such as Nostocine A, Toxoflavin, and Fluviol from GTP using enzymes similar to those in the synthesis pathway of Riboflavin (vitamin B2). These triazine derivatives show antibiotic activity. In particular, research on Toxoflavin has progressed as a toxin produced by bacteria that cause seedling rot and rice grain blight in rice. It has recently been revealed that Fluviol, which is produced by bacteria, acts to suppress the growth of pathogenic bacteria. This review will focus on triazine derivatives produced by bacteria.
40043969	Ureases in nature: Multifaceted roles and implications for plant and human health - A review.	Urease, a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia, plays a pivotal role in nitrogen metabolism across diverse organisms. While essential for survival, its unregulated activity is implicated in numerous pathologies, including peptic ulcers, nephropathy, and gastric cancer, as well as agricultural challenges such as soil ammonium depletion and reduced nitrogen-use efficiency. Beyond its canonical enzymatic function, urease engages in protein-protein interactions with bioactive counterparts like jaburetox, canatoxin, and soyuretox plant-derived proteins with insecticidal, antifungal, and membranolytic properties. Exploring the relationship between ureases and these proteins, along with their mechanistic synergies, presents novel opportunities to develop targeted inhibitors for urease-related diseases while unlocking broader therapeutic and biotechnological applications. This review delves into the dual roles of ureases in plants and humans, bridging the gap between their ureolytic and non-ureolytic activities. We highlight recent advances in the design of urease inhibitors, which have emerged as critical tools for managing pathologies such as Helicobacter pylori-induced ulcers and urease-mediated kidney stone formation. These inhibitors also hold transformative potential in agriculture, where they mitigate nitrogen loss by stabilizing urea fertilizers, thereby enhancing crop yields and reducing environmental pollution. Furthermore, their utility extends to industrial biotechnology, including biofilm disruption and wastewater treatment, where urease inhibition prevents microbially induced corrosion and ammonia toxicity. The collected information is anticipated to offer insightful guidance and effective strategies for developing novel potent and safe urease inhibitors in the future.
40043878	Effects of herbicide mixtures on the diversity and composition of microbial community and nitrogen cycling function on agricultural soil: A field experiment in Northeast China.	Herbicide mixtures application is a widespread and effective practice in modern agriculture; however, a knowledge gap exists regarding the potential ecotoxicological effects of herbicide mixtures in agricultural systems. Here, the effects of various doses of herbicide mixtures (atrazine, nicosulfuron, and mesotrione) under different varieties of maize cultivation on the structure and function of microbial communities and soil chemical parameters were clarified through field experiments. The results showed that the application of herbicide mixtures increased the bacterial and fungal community alpha diversity at jointing and maturity, indicating a prolonged effect of the herbicide mixtures. Moreover, herbicide mixtures alter the composition of bacterial and fungal communities, with sensitive taxa suppressed and herbicide-tolerant taxa enriched. The herbicide mixtures significantly reduced the abundances of Bacillus even at lower doses, but Penicillum was enriched. FAPROTAX analysis and quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed that herbicide mixtures inhibited the soil nitrogen-cycle process and related genes AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, and nifH at maize seedling stage. Moreover, network analysis showed that low concentrations of the herbicide mixtures increased bacterial interactions while high concentrations inhibited them, which indicated that the network complexity may be herbicide concentration dependent. A synthetic community (SynCom) consisting of six bacterial strains was established for the biodegradation of the herbicide mixtures based on the analysis of the bacterial network, which resulted in an increase in the degradation efficiency of nicosulfuron by 15.90%. Moreover, potted maize experiment showed that the addition of the SynCom alleviated the toxic effects of herbicide mixtures on the plants. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive perspective for assessing the ecological risk at taxonomic and functional levels and the biodegradation approach of herbicide mixtures residue on agricultural soils in Northeastern China.
40043660	Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochloride pesticides (OCPs) in sediment from the Beibu Gulf, China: Occurrence, spatial-temporal distribution, source, historical variation and ecological risks.	This study comprehensively analyzed 11 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 16 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in 87 surface sediment samples collected across two seasons and in a sediment core from the Beibu Gulf, China. Overall, only a limited number and low concentrations of PCBs and OCPs were detected. In surface sediments, ΣPCBs concentrations were higher in summer (mean: 0.27 ± 0.37 ng/g dw) compared to winter (mean: 0.07 ± 0.06 ng/g dw), while ΣOCPs showed no significant seasonal variation (summer, mean: 0.19 ± 0.19 ng/g dw; winter, mean: 0.17 ± 0.07 ng/g dw). 4,4'-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB 28), 2,3,5,6-Tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 65) and p,p'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were the most predominant contaminants, with average concentrations accounting for >90 % of the ΣPCBs and ΣOCPs, respectively. Spatial distribution revealed higher ΣPCBs concentrations in the southern Beibu Gulf compared to other areas. Industrial productions, shipping activities, as well as ocean current transport appear to be key sources of PCBs in studied region, while the aerobic degradation of residual DDT likely explains the widespread presence of DDE. In sediment core, both ΣPCBs and ΣOCPs exhibited parabolic variation trends along the sediment core depth, reflecting historical use in the Beibu Gulf, with recent declines in new inputs. Risk assessments indicated that PCBs and OCPs in Beibu Gulf sediments pose minimal ecological risks. These findings offer valuable scientific insights to support future research on typical organic pollutants in the Beibu Gulf.
40043561	Reapplication of glyphosate mitigate fitness costs for soil bacterial communities.	Glyphosate (GLP) is a globally ubiquitous herbicide that poses a threat to living organisms due to its widespread presence in soil ecosystems. However, the results of current research regarding the effects of glyphosate on soil microorganisms and its ecological risks are vague and inconsistent. In this study, we investigated the impact of single (low/high-dose) and reapplication (high-dose) of glyphosate applications on soil microbes through indoor incubation experiments using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing technology. Our findings indicate that in the short term, whether it's single or reapplication glyphosate applications, changes in diversities of soil bacterial community were less than those in community composition. Glyphosate exerts selective pressure on soil microbial communities, resulting in a predominant process of species replacement after glyphosate application, and quantitative analysis revealed a higher turnover rate of microbial communities under glyphosate reapplication. Factors related to nitrogen cycling, especially NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, were identified as the main drivers responsible for the changes in soil microbial community composition following glyphosate addition. Changes in the functionality of soil microbial communities are observed after glyphosate application, with the adaptability of microbial communities resulting in smaller changes with reapplication addition compared to a single application. Furthermore, We observed that glyphosate application leads to a phenomenon resembling the "fitness cost" found in resistant bacteria. When glyphosate as a single application, it has a significant impact on bacterial communities, leading to decreased community diversity, stability, and function, alongside alterations in community structure, however, the effect can be mitigated by reapplying glyphosate.
40043501	Paternal fenvalerate exposure causes depressive-like behaviour by altering Grb10 gene DNA methylation in adolescent offspring.	Fenvalerate, a typical pyrethroid pesticide, is a neurological toxicant. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of paternal exposure to fenvalerate on depressive-like behaviours in adolescent offspring. Depression-like behavior was determined by Sucrose Preference Test (SPT), Tail Suspension Test (TST) and Forced Swimming Test (FST) in adolescent offspring. The level of dopamine was reduced in the midbrain of fenvalerate-exposed adolescent offspring. Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), a rate limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis, was significantly reduced in the midbrain of adolescent offspring exposed to fenvalerate. And Th was decreased in the midbrain and hindbrain of fetuses exposed to fenvalerate. Transcriptome analysis revealed growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10) was decreased in the fetal hindbrain exposed to fenvalerate. Grb10 mRNA and protein were reduced in the fetal hindbrain exposed to fenvalerate. Interestingly, in vitro experiments, Th was reduced by si-Grb10. Conversely, Th was increased by oe-Grb10. Mechanistically, the 5mC content of Grb10 gene at one CpG fragment was reduced in the fetal hindbrain exposed to fenvalerate. And the 5mC content of Grb10 gene at eighteen CpG sites was decreased in paternal sperm exposed to fenvalerate. In summary, paternal fenvalerate exposure causes depressive-like behavior by altering DNA methylation of Grb10 gene in the sperm.
40043403	Insights on persistent herbicides in cropland soils in northern China: Occurrence, ecological risks, and phytotoxicity to subsequent crops.	Herbicides are essential inputs in agriculture, but their long-term persistence creates underappreciated risks in intensive cropping systems. While previous studies focused on single-herbicide persistence, the cumulative ecological and agronomic impacts of multi-herbicide residues remain poorly understood, particularly in phytotoxicity to subsequent crops. This study investigated the occurrence, ecological risk, and phytotoxicity of six persistent herbicides in cropland soils in northern China. Herbicide contamination was widespread, with at least one herbicide detected in 90.9 % of soil samples. The most frequently detected herbicides were atrazine (54.6 %), deethylatrazine (41.1 %), fomesafen (47.3 %), and nicosulfuron (54.3 %), with mean concentrations of 9, 7, 41, and 99 μg/kg dw, respectively. Clomazone and imazethapyr were detected in 5.5 % and 0.8 % of samples, with mean concentrations of 8 and 4 μg/kg dw, respectively. Risk quotient (RQ) values indicated that clomazone (0.004), fomesafen (0.001), and imazethapyr (0.00006) pose low ecological risk (RQ<0.01), whereas nicosulfuron (26.95) and atrazine (2.54) present high ecological risk (RQ≥1). Phytotoxicity risks to subsequent crops, including tobacco, were identified for atrazine (28.6 % of soils), nicosulfuron (26.4 % of soils), and fomesafen (14 % of soils). Most subsequent crops, like soybean and wheat, were unaffected by atrazine residues in over 99 % of the soils. These findings provide key data for agricultural management.
40043018	Unprecedented Alkylation of the Catalytic Histidine in the Aging of Cholinesterases after Inhibition by Organophosphorus Pesticides.	Organophosphorus (OP) compounds pose a serious risk to human health by covalently modifying acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Currently approved oxime therapeutics can reactivate OP-inhibited AChE and BChE, despite significant limitations. The OP-inhibited enzymes undergo a secondary <i>O</i>-dealkylation event, known as aging, for which no currently approved therapeutics are effective as treatments. Many decades of research have studied the aging mechanism in AChE and BChE. It has previously been accepted that aging occurs via a spontaneous <i>O</i>-dealkylation event, by loss of a carbocation or by water hydrolysis of the OP-adducted serine residue. Here, we present a novel mechanism of aging in which the catalytic histidine acts as a nucleophile to induce aging and, as a result, becomes alkylated after exposure to methyl paraoxon (MP) and other pesticides. Using bottom-up proteomics, we identify that upon aging of MP-inhibited AChE and BChE, a methyl transfer occurs from the phosphylated serine residue to the catalytic histidine residue. The extent of histidine methylation is pH-dependent as less methylation is observed at lower pH, while increased methylation is observed at higher pH. At near physiological pH (7.5), the ratio of <i>N</i>-MeHis/His is 3:1 for AChE and 1.3:1 for BChE after 24 h. When other OP compounds were also tested for histidine modification, ethyl paraoxon was shown to result in ethylation of the catalytic histidine; however, when the alkoxy group was branched in the case of an isopropoxy group present in diisopropyl fluorophosphate, no alkylation of histidine was observed. Recent advances in the development of quinone methide precursors show promise in the recovery of OP-aged AChE. In this work, we discuss the importance of this novel aging mechanism and its impact on the recoverability of OP-aged AChE or BChE as it appears that the histidine modification limits the overall recovery of active AChE.

40042937	Discovery of <i>N</i>-Phenylphthalimides Containing Ether Moiety as Potential Protoporphyrinogen IX Oxidase Inhibitors.	The discovery of novel protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO) inhibitors has become a key focus in herbicide development. To explore new PPO inhibitors, a series of <i>N</i>-phenylphthalimide derivatives with ether moieties were designed and successfully synthesized. Among these, compound <b>B18</b> (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 10.3 nM) exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on <i>Nt</i>PPO, outperforming flumiclorac-pentyl (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 46.3 nM) and flumioxazin (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 52.0 nM). It is noted that compounds <b>A3</b>, <b>B18</b>, <b>B19</b>, and <b>B20</b> showed broad-spectrum herbicidal activity against the tested weeds at 75 g a.i./ha. In addition, results of molecular simulation and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that compound <b>B18</b> possessed not only a robust hydrogen bond with Arg98 of <i>Nt</i>PPO but also superior chemical reactivity, electrostatic field, and strong polarity. Therefore, compound <b>B18</b> may be regarded as a promising lead compound for the development of high-efficiency PPO inhibitors.
40042570	Expanding the functional landscape of microbial entomopathogens in agriculture beyond pest management.	Microbial entomopathogens that include fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes have long been valued for their role in biological control of insect pests. However, recent research highlights their expanded applications beyond pest management. Entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium spp. are increasingly recognized for their potential as biocontrol agents in integrated pest management systems. These fungi exhibit not only direct insecticidal effects but also secondary metabolites that contribute to plant disease suppression, thereby enhancing crop health and yield. Bacterial entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis, as the most widely used biopesticide, has also demonstrated potency not only against insects but also as systemic resistance inducer, thereby boosting plant immunity against pathogens. Moreover, entomopathogens are emerging as growth promoters and biostimulants, enhancing crop vigor through nutrient uptake and root development. This review consolidates current knowledge on the mechanisms of action of microbial entomopathogens against pests as well as current understanding on its other plant-beneficial traits. It also discusses their environmental impact and potential integration into sustainable agricultural practices. This comprehensive exploration underscores the transformative potential of microbial entomopathogens in shaping future strategies for holistic crop health management including pest management in agriculture.

40042242	Recent advances in MXene nanozyme-based optical and electrochemical biosensors for food safety analysis.	The importance of nanotechnology is increasing every day in different fields and, especially, the application of nanomaterials has attracted considerable attention in food safety. Among different nanomaterials, MXenes, which are two-dimensional (2D) transition metal-based layered materials made of nitrides and carbides, have revolutionized various fields as a cutting-edge scientific discovery in nanotechnology. These materials have been widely used in the structure of biosensors and sensors due to their excellent metallic conductivity, mechanical stability, optical absorbance, good redox capability, and higher heterogeneous electron transfer rate. In particular, the application of MXenes as nanozymes has highlighted their high performance to a great extent in biosensor domains. The growing interest in these nanozymes is attributed to their specific physicochemical features. The key enzymatic features of these materials include activities similar to oxidase, peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. In this review, initially, several common synthesis methods of MXenes are presented, emphasizing their significant role as nanozymes in constructing efficient sensors. Subsequently, several common applications of MXene nanozymes in food safety analysis are delved into, including the detection of bacteria, mycotoxins, antibiotic residues, and pesticide residues, along with their applications in different electrochemical and optical biosensors. In addition, the gap, limitation, and future perspective of these novel nanozymes in food safety are highlighted.
40042057	Insight into the Underlying Molecular Toxic Mechanisms of Cyantraniliprole and Broflanilide against Different Targets with Glutathione Transferase Phi8 from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.	As two typical kinds of diamide insecticides, cyantraniliprole and broflanilide are characterized by diverse target receptors and completely distinctive regulation mechanisms. However, the systematical evaluation of oxidative damage on plants induced by cyantraniliprole and broflanilide still remains elusive. In this study, the toxic effects were investigated in the biochemical and physiological aspects using <i>At</i>GSTF8 as a biomarker. First, cyantraniliprole not only brought about much more detrimental impacts on the growth status of plant seedlings but also resulted in a significant upregulation of <i>At</i>GSTF8 gene expression compared to broflanilide. Then, the glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase activities of <i>At</i>GSTF8 decreased greatly with treatment of these two diamide insecticides. Moreover, biolayer interferometry analysis confirmed the interactions of both cyantraniliprole and broflanilide with <i>At</i>GSTF8, especially for cyantraniliprole with stronger binding affinity, which conformed to the molecular docking results. At last, even more adverse effects on the structural conformations of <i>At</i>GSTF8 upon binding with cyantraniliprole were observed.
40041960	Co-exposure to a honeybee pathogen and an insecticide: synergistic effects in a new solitary bee host but not in <i>Apis mellifera</i>.	Pesticides and pathogens are major drivers of bee declines. However, their potential interactions are poorly understood, especially for non-<i>Apis</i> bees. This study assessed the combined effects of infestation by the honeybee pathogen <i>Vairimorpha ceranae</i> and chronic exposure to the insecticide flupyradifurone on <i>Osmia bicornis</i> and <i>Apis mellifera</i>. We investigated whether <i>V. ceranae</i> could reproduce in a new solitary bee host (<i>O. bicornis</i>) and assessed sublethal and lethal effects of the pathogen and the pesticide, alone and in combination. We also analysed the interactive effects of the combined exposure on <i>V. ceranae</i> proliferation and bee survival in the two bee species. Newly emerged bees were orally infected with 100 000 spores of <i>V. ceranae</i> and then exposed ad libitum to flupyradifurone at field-realistic concentrations. We showed, for the first time to our knowledge, that <i>V. ceranae</i> can replicate in the midgut of <i>O. bicornis</i>, causing histological damage, impaired phototactic response, reduced food consumption and decreased longevity. The pathogen-pesticide combination caused a synergistic effect in <i>O. bicornis,</i> leading to an abrupt survival decline. In <i>A. mellifera</i>, <i>V. ceranae</i> and flupyradifurone showed antagonistic survival effects, but the pesticide promoted pathogen proliferation. Our results warn against the potential effects of pathogen spillover and multiple stressor exposure on non-<i>Apis</i> bees.
40041041	Design and validation of a low-cost sugar-feeder for resource-poor insectaries.	The emergence of insecticide resistance in insects has led researchers to develop new control tools so that historic gains made in reducing disease transmission are not lost. Attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) are a vector control tool being widely trialled to target insects that feed on plant sugars and blood. We designed a field-friendly, economical and more environmentally responsible sugar feeder for maintaining mosquito colonies and screening potential ATSB candidates.
40040590	Efficacy and cost of four plant-derived, natural herbicides for certified organic agriculture.	Weed management is the greatest production challenge for most certified organic farmers, with few herbicides allowed on organic farms. Here, we compared the efficacy and cost of handhoeing (MECH) with a control (no weed management) and four commercially available registered organic herbicides under United States Department of Agriculture organic standards in managing Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) and total vegetative cover in two apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) orchards. The four herbicide treatments had the following active ingredients: capric and caprylic acid (CAP), d-limonene (LIM), acetic and citric acid (ACET), and clove and cinnamon oil (CIN). In separate greenhouse trials, Canada thistle response to CAP (at two concentrations), LIM, glyphosate (GLY), and MECH were also studied.
40040532	Multiple Stressors Simplify Freshwater Food Webs.	Globally, freshwater ecosystems are threatened by multiple stressors, yet our knowledge of how they interact to affect food web structure remains scant. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a large-scale mesocosm experiment to quantify the single and combined effects of three common anthropogenic stressors: warming, increased nutrient loading, and insecticide pollution, on the network structure of shallow lake food webs. We identified both antagonistic and synergistic interactive effects depending on whether the stressors affected negative or positive feedback loops, respectively. Overall, multiple stressors simplified the food web, elongated energy transfer pathways, and shifted biomass distribution from benthic to more pelagic pathways. This increased the risk of a regime shift from a clear-water state dominated by submerged macrophytes to a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton. Our novel results highlight how multiple anthropogenic stressors can interactively disrupt food webs, with implications for understanding and managing aquatic ecosystems in a changing world.
40040492	Discovery of <i>N</i>-((2-Arylthiazol-4-yl)methyl)oxazole-5-carboxamide Derivatives as SDHi for Fungicidal Candidates.	A series of oxazole-5-carboxamide derivatives were designed as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitors and synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for their fungicidal activities. Among these compounds, <b>SEZA18</b> and <b>SEZC7</b> displayed 0.17 and 0.50 mg/L EC<sub>50</sub> values against <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i> in vitro, respectively, whose anti-<i>M. grisea</i> activities were closed to prochloraz (0.15 mg/L) and surpassed hymexazol (45.5 mg/L). Moreover, <b>SEZA18</b> and <b>SEZC7</b> exhibited 45.3 and 49.5% protective effects against <i>M. grisea</i> at the dose of 200 mg/L <i>in vivo,</i> whose preventive effects were about double times less than that of azoxystrobin (93%). In addition, <b>SEZA14</b> possessed an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.33 mg/L against <i>Penicillium digitatum</i> in vitro and showed 77.9% prevention effects from <i>P. digitatum</i> at the dose of 100 mg/L in a potted experiment, whose fungicidal activity was comparable to that of boscalid (75.5%). <b>SEZC7</b> demonstrated SDH inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 16.6 μM), exhibiting activity levels similar to those of boscalid (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.9 μM). Molecular docking results further revealed that <b>SEZA14</b>, <b>SEZA18</b>, <b>SEZC7</b>, and boscalid possessed a mode of action similar to that of SDH. Transcriptome analysis suggested that <b>C7</b> interfered with the energy metabolism by inhibiting SDH activity, thereby affecting cellular sugar metabolism processes of <i>M. grisea</i>. In summary, our finding gave SDH inhibitors featuring novel structures, which provided a potential candidate for the management of plant pathogenic fungi.
40040370	Optimal use of insecticide against the small brown planthopper, <i>Laodelphax striatellus</i>, effectively reduces the damage caused by Rice stripe virus.	Rice stripe virus disease is one of the most devastating diseases of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in East Asia. The causal virus, Rice stripe virus (RSV), is persistently transmitted by the small brown planthopper (<i>Laodelphax striatellus</i>, SBPH). Since there is no effective treatment once rice plants are infected with RSV, it is crucial to prevent RSV infection in rice to minimize the damage. This study evaluated the effect of SBPH control with insecticides applied to the nursery box at transplanting and/or sprayed in the field on RSV infection and yield loss. We found that insecticide application either to nursery boxes or in the field reduced the percentage of diseased plants, the magnitude of damage in diseased plants, and yield loss. The combination of nursery box and field insecticide applications was the most effective at controlling the disease as it provided seamless control of SBPH from transplanting to the initial panicle formation stage. The study results offer a detailed description of the process by which chemical control of SBPH reduces damage caused by RSV. We expect these findings to be useful in developing an integrated pest management system for RSV.
40040185	Integrating Microfluidics and Deep Learning to Investigate Entomopathogenic Nematode Responses to Host Cues.	Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are effective biocontrol agents, reducing pesticide impact on health and the environment. Understanding their physiology and ethology is crucial for optimizing their application. This study offers innovative insights about Steinernema carpocapsae EPN behavior, contributing to the interdisciplinary field of engineering, biology, and entomology. The proposed hybrid approach combines microfluidics, deep learning, and optical flow. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model discerned EPNs in the presence of stimuli within a specially designed microfluidic arena, highlighting motor behavior differences. At the video level, the CNN model accurately discriminated a context characterized by host-borne cues, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.938, precision of 1, and f1-score of 0.933. Integrating optical flow analysis unveiled a significant difference in motor activity, adding novel information on their dynamic responses. EPNs showed an increased activity in stimulus presence. This comprehensive approach advances our capability to detect and comprehend the responses of EPN to host stimuli for more precise and targeted biocontrol strategies.
40039709	Optimizing Warfarin Dosing Using Contextual Bandit: An Offline Policy Learning and Evaluation Method.	Warfarin, an anticoagulant medication, is formulated to prevent and address conditions associated with abnormal blood clotting, making it one of the most prescribed drugs globally. However, determining the suitable dosage remains challenging due to individual response variations, and prescribing an incorrect dosage may lead to severe consequences. Contextual bandit and reinforcement learning have shown promise in addressing this issue. Given the wide availability of observational data and safety concerns of decision-making in healthcare, we focused on using exclusively observational data from historical policies as demonstrations to derive new policies; we utilized offline policy learning and evaluation in a contextual bandit setting to establish the optimal personalized dosage strategy. Our learned policies surpassed these baseline approaches without genotype inputs, even when given a suboptimal demonstration, showcasing promising application potential.
40038831	Computational histology reveals that concomitant application of insect repellent with sunscreen impairs UV protection in an ex vivo human skin model.	Histological alterations such as nuclear abnormalities are sensitive biomarkers associated with diseases, tissue injury and environmental insults. While visual inspection and human interpretation of histology images are useful for initial characterization, such low-throughput procedures suffer from inherent limitations in terms of reliability, objectivity and reproducibility. Artificial intelligence and digital morphometry offer unprecedented opportunities to quickly and accurately assess nuclear morphotypes in relation to tissue damage including skin injury.

40037896	Haloalkane dehalogenases other than LinB can contribute to the γ-hexachlorocyclohexane utilization.	Haloalkane dehalogenases (HLDs) convert halogenated compounds to corresponding alcohols by a simple hydrolytic mechanism. Although many bacterial strains possess HLDs or HLD homologues, LinB is the only HLD known to be involved in the utilization of γ-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH), a man-made chlorinated pesticide. In this study, to gain insight into the functional evolution of HLDs toward the γ-HCH utilization, the linB gene in γ-HCH-degrading Sphingobium japonicum strain UT26 was replaced by 7 other HLD or HLD homologous genes, including 3 putative ancestral enzymes. Interestingly, strains carrying genes for DmmA from marine metagenome or Rluc_anc, an ancestor of Renilla-luciferin 2-monooxygenase (Rluc) and LinB, produced 2,5-dichlorophenol and 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone from γ-HCH, which are indicators of LinB activity, and grew in minimal medium supplied with γ-HCH as a sole carbon source. These results indicated that other HLDs in addition to LinB can play roles in the γ-HCH utilization.
40037601	Cultivating resilience: assessing commercial strawberry cultivars for chilli thrips management in Florida strawberries.	Strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne (Rosales: Rosaceae), is an important specialty crop in Florida, generating about $500 million in annual revenue. An invasive insect, chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), has emerged as a major strawberry pest, causing considerable yield and revenue loss in recent years. Pesticide application is the leading control option but is not always recommended due to resistance development. Host plant resistance (HPR) can be a novel option to manage S. dorsalis sustainably. Four commercial cultivars, 'Florida Brilliance', 'Florida Medallion FL16.30-128', 'Sweet Sensation 'Florida127', and 'Florida Pearl FL16.78-109', were evaluated for their performance in the 2021-2022 field season under the natural population of S. dorsalis. In 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, 3 more cultivars, 'Strawberry Festival', 'Florida Radiance', and 'Florida Beauty', were added to this list. Twenty bare-root strawberry transplants were planted in each field plot, and each cultivar was replicated 8 times in a randomized complete block design. Damage on trifoliate, number of adults and larval S. dorsalis on trifoliate, number of flowers, and marketable fruit yield were assessed for each cultivar. Results revealed that 'Florida Pearl 109' had the highest insect count and damage index of all 3 year. 'Strawberry Festival' also showed the same trend after its introduction in the second year. 'Florida Brilliance' and 'Sweet Sensation' had the lowest damage index, lowest adult insect count, and higher marketable yield compared to 'Florida Pearl 109' and 'Strawberry Festival'. Therefore, utilizing resistant cultivars can be an effective tool for managing S. dorsalis in the field.
40037588	Toxic effects of atrazine on freshwater mussels (Elliptio complanata).	Atrazine (ATR) is a commonly found herbicide contaminant in water bodies across the United States. In this study, native freshwater mussels (Elliptio complanata) were investigated to determine histopathological effects and bioaccumulation of ATR under laboratory conditions. Mussels were collected from the Rice Creek Field Station, Oswego, NY, and were exposed to two different concentrations of ATR (15 and 150 μg/L) for 4 weeks. Histopathological phenotypes induced by ATR include reduced or no ciliary epithelium, ciliary cells merged or completely absent, skeletal rods and connective tissue reduced, causing malformed gill filaments; inhibition of condensation of spermatogenic cells and induced necrosis in spermatocytes in testis; disintegration of acini, oocytes, follicles, and epithelium of the duct, disintegration of the yolk and stalk connecting acini to the follicular wall in ovaries. There were no apparent ATR-mediated histopathological effects in the mantle tissue. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify the levels of bioaccumulation of ATR in the tissues where the teratogenic effects are observed from the histological analysis. Bioaccumulation of ATR was observed in gills (0.11 µg/g in the ATR 15 µg/L group and 0.51 µg/g in the ATR 150 µg/L group) and visceral tissues (0.11 µg/g in the ATR 15 µg/L group and 0.63 µg/g in the ATR 150 µg/L), correlating with the histopathological phenotypes. ATR's action mechanism is identified as induced apoptosis in the cells. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the biochemical response and determine the derivates of ATR in this species.
40037586	Effects of realistic pesticide mixtures on the springtail Folsomia candida.	The application of multiple pesticides over the last decades has resulted in their frequent and in some cases long-term presence in soils as complex mixtures. This work assessed the toxicity of realistic pesticide mixtures observed in 11 case study sites to the springtail Folsomia candida. Each mixture was composed of 5 pesticides (as active substances or metabolites), chosen based on their occurrence in soil and expected risk to soil invertebrates. Reproduction tests were conducted in natural agricultural soil, and the springtails were exposed to 3 concentrations of the selected pesticides: the median environmental concentration (MEC), the predicted environmental concentration (PEC), and 5 times PEC (5PEC). No significant effect was observed at MEC exposure in any case study sites, however, effects on reproduction, adult survival, and adult size were observed at PEC and 5PEC exposures on 5 case study sites. Risk quotients (RQ) of individual pesticides were calculated by dividing the exposure concentrations (MEC, PEC, and 5PEC) by the NOEC values from the literature, and the sum of the 5 pesticides was calculated as ∑RQ in each case study site. The toxicity at PEC exposure was higher than expected based on the ∑RQ in two case study sites, indicating a possible synergistic mixture effect. This work provides new information on the effects of realistic pesticide mixtures. Further research is required to clarify whether the current risk assessment of individual pesticides adequately protects soil species from exposure to multiple pesticide residues that may occur in even more complex mixtures.
40037548	Embryonic exposure to valproic acid and neonicotinoid deteriorates the hyperpolarizing GABA shift and impairs long-term potentiation of excitatory transmission in the local circuit of intermediate medial mesopallium of chick telencephalon.	Embryonic exposure to valproic acid and imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) impairs filial imprinting in hatchlings, and the deteriorating effects of valproic acid are mitigated by post-hatch injection of bumetanide, a blocker of the chloride intruder Na-K-2Cl cotransporter 1. Here, we report that these exposures depolarized the reversal potential of local GABAergic transmission in the neurons of the intermediate medial mesopallium, the pallial region critical for imprinting. Furthermore, exposure increased field excitatory post-synaptic potentials in pre-tetanus recordings and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) by low-frequency tetanic stimulation. Bath-applied bumetanide rescued the impaired LTP in the valproic acid slices, whereas VU0463271, a blocker of the chloride extruder KCC2, suppressed LTP in the control slices, suggesting that hyperpolarizing GABA action is necessary for the potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission. Whereas a steep increase in the gene expression of KCC2 appeared compared to NKCC1 during the peri-hatch development, significant differences were not found between valproic acid and control post-hatch chicks in these genes. Instead, both valproic acid and imidacloprid downregulated several transcriptional regulators (FOS, NR4A1, and NR4A2) and upregulated the RNA component of signal recognition particles (RN7SL1). Despite different chemical actions, valproic acid and imidacloprid could cause common neuronal effects that lead to impaired imprinting.
40037536	Tribenuron-methyl inhibit greenhouse gas emission and impacted the related functional pathways.	This study investigates the combined effects of tribenuron-methyl and urea on soil bacterial communities, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycle-related functions. High-throughput sequencing revealed significant impacts on bacterial diversity and composition, with responses varying across different concentrations, sampling times, and the presence of urea. Tribenuron-methyl inhibited bacterial diversity at early sampling times but increased diversity after 60 days in the highest treatment. The impact on bacterial phyla varied across treatments, with notable fluctuations in Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobiota abundance. Tribenuron-methyl also caused distinct shifts in bacterial community structure, with pronounced effects in the presence of urea. Tribenuron-methyl significantly suppressed CO2 release but had no significant effect on N2O emissions. Urea addition enhanced N2O release without altering the impact of tribenuron-methyl. Functional pathway analysis indicated that tribenuron-methyl inhibited C cycle-related enzymes, particularly without urea addition, while its effect on N cycle-related enzymes was minimal. These findings highlight the dynamic interactions between herbicides, nitrogen fertilizers, and soil microbial processes, offering insights into their ecological impacts and implications for agricultural management.
40037191	Few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> co-assembly with GO to optimize defect channels and stability of GO membranes for high-performance organic-inorganic separation.	The selective separation of organic compounds and inorganic salts is essential for wastewater recycling in fine chemical industries such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Membrane separation technology offers a promising solution. However, conventional organic membranes often face challenges related to precise separation and solvent resistance. While graphene oxide (GO) membranes exhibit excellent solvent resistance, their separation performance and structural stability require further improvement. In this study, we developed a GO/few-layer molybdenum disulfide (FLMoS<sub>2</sub>) membrane via co-assembly. The optimized GO/FLMoS<sub>2</sub> membrane demonstrated a water permeability of 28.4 LMH/bar, approximately four times higher than conventional GO membranes, and achieved a separation factor exceeding 900 for organic/inorganic mixtures-among the highest reported for two-dimensional (2D) membranes. Comprehensive characterization, including low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), revealed that this superior performance was attributed to controlled defect channels, enhanced interlayer cross-linking, and the intrinsic rigidity of FLMoS<sub>2</sub>, which provided high structural stability and minimal swelling. Moreover, mechanical strength assessments, including critical destructive load force and nanoindentation tests, confirmed significant improvement in structural robustness. As a result, the GO/FLMoS<sub>2</sub> membrane maintained stable water permeability and separation efficiency over 100 hours of continuous operation and six chemical cleaning cycles, demonstrating its potential for sustainable wastewater treatment and resource recovery.
40037080	Exposure to thiazole pesticides disrupts pathogens and undermines keystone status of rare taxa within bacterial ecological networks.	Considering the sensitivity of rare microbial taxa to environmental disturbances and their critical roles in ecosystems, it is essential to investigate how soil microbial communities (particularly rare microbes) respond to pesticide exposure. In this study, we found that thiazole pesticides significantly reduced the severity of potato common scab and effectively disrupted the pathogen's cell membrane integrity. Notably, hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that the rare microbial taxa in potato geocaulosphere soil constitute key clusters influencing disease incidence. Within bacterial molecular ecological networks, nodes corresponding to these rare taxa generally exhibited higher degrees compared to those of more abundant taxa. However, pesticide exposure reduced the number of keystone nodes and substantially weakened the hub status of rare bacterial taxa in these networks. These findings suggest that, although thiazole pesticides effectively eradicate pathogens, they may also pose a non-negligible potential risk to rare taxa in agricultural ecosystems.
40037043	Processing factors of pesticide residues in durum wheat milling fractions and pasta.	A total of 242 processing factors (Pf) were determined for 34 pesticides studied in milling products (flour, semolina, bran, middlings, fine bran), in refined and wholemeal pasta. The durum wheat cv Platone was grown in the field and was treated with formulations containing acetamiprid, λ-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, benzovindiflupyr, and prothioconazole, at dosages 5 times higher than the label. Part of the untreated wheat was fortified in the laboratory with a mixture of 31 pesticides (organophosphates, organochlorines, pyrethroids, and others) at spiking levels of 1.8-3.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Pilot plants were used to simulate industrial milling and pasta-making processes. Pesticide residues, determined using the QuEChERS method with LC/GC-MS/MS techniques, resulted low in flour, semolina, and pasta (Pf < 1) but high in bran and middlings (Pf = 1.9-6.8). Careful selection of the wheat quality for bran and wholemeal foods is necessary to protect human and animal health.
40037024	Pesticide fate under varying cropping systems and soil depths: A study using leaching experiments and inverse modelling.	Current pesticide leaching risk assessments overlook critical site-specific factors such as soil depth and agricultural practices. Relying on transport parameters from databases or manufacturer studies, often based on limited soil types, can lead to inaccurate contamination risk estimates and ineffective protection of groundwater resources. In this study, the fate of eight pesticides of concern for groundwater was investigated under three cropping systems and three soil depths. Leaching experiments were carried out in undisturbed columns from a loamy agricultural soil and mass balances were realized. Inverse dual-porosity modelling using Hydrus 1-D was then performed to adjust mobility parameters. The results reveal that different soil properties and structure between soil depths have a more substantial impact on pesticide leaching behaviour than the cropping systems. Significant differences in pesticide transport and retention are observed between soil horizons, illustrating the inadequacy of using surface parameters for the entire soil profile, which can lead to underestimation of groundwater contamination. Our analysis indicates that root architecture, soil properties and surface tillage can affect pesticide leaching dynamics. While short-term differences between cropping systems were limited, these factors could be important for long-term effects. The experimental transport parameters showed discrepancies with established databases, where higher adsorption and degradation could underestimate pesticide leaching and metabolites production. This study highlights the need to adapt transport parameter values for all pesticides of concern to site-specific conditions. In addition, accurate risk assessment requires advanced modelling techniques that take into account soil depth variability and local conditions to improve water protection decision-making. Future research should focus on long-term monitoring of the effects of sustainable agricultural practices on pesticide behaviour over several seasons and for a range of soil types. Special emphasis should be placed on the role of metabolites in environmental contamination.
40036967	Investigation of Nanoflow Liquid Chromatography High-Resolution MS (nanoLC-HRMS) for the Analysis of Veterinary Drug Residues in Fish and Shrimp.	A wide-scope screening method for veterinary drugs and other contaminants in aquaculture products using LC high resolution MS (HRMS) was developed previously. Using nanoflow LC could significantly increase the sensitivity of this method.
40036914	Preparation of boric acid functionalized hyper-crosslinked polymer for efficient extraction of phenylurea herbicides from lake water, green tea drink and tomato samples.	A boric acid functionalized hyper-crosslinked polymer (HCP), designated as NPCBA/TBM-HCP, was successfully synthesized via Friedel-Crafts reaction by copolymerizing N-phenylcarbazole-2-boronic acid (NPCBA) and 2,4,6-Tris(bromomethyl)mesitylene (TBM). The NPCBA/TBM-HCP showed a large surface area and a good adsorption property for phenylurea herbicides (PUHs). A method with NPCBA/TBM-HCP based solid phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatographic detection was developed for the simultaneous analysis of PUHs in lake water, green tea drink and tomato samples. Under the optimized experimental conditions that the amount of the NPCBA/TBM-HCP was 30 mg, sample solution was 100 mL, sample loading rate was 4 mL min<sup>-1</sup>, and eluent was 0.3 mL acetonitrile, the linear response for the PUHs was in the range of 0.06-80.0 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, 0.6-80.0 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.9-200 ng g<sup>-1</sup> for lake water, green tea drink and tomato samples, respectively, with a good linearity (the coefficients of determination (r<sup>2</sup>) ≥ 0.9916). The detection limits (S/N = 3) for lake water, green tea drink and tomato samples were 0.02-0.03 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, 0.2 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.3-0.5 ng g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The method recoveries for spiked samples were 80.0 %-119.1 % and RSDs were lower than 9.9 % for the determination. The method provides a new and feasible approach for the determination of phenylurea herbicide in real samples.
40036830	Potential of repurposed agricultural ingredients in propylene glycol emulsions as oral toxicants for control of adult mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae).	Mosquito control operations have limited options available for adult mosquito reduction. Untapped alternatives exist in adjacent pest-management industries, but translation and validation for various technologies is still ongoing. The attractive targeted sugar bait (ATSB) strategy is a formulation platform that is amenable to toxicants not otherwise widely used for adult mosquito control techniques and equipment. To find fast-acting, effective toxicants for ATSB, choice assays were conducted using fipronil, spinosyn, dinotefuran, clothianidin, imidacloprid, bifenazate, indoxacarb, abamectin, and λ-cyhalothrin against Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culcidae) as a model system. Active ingredients were emulsified in propylene glycol, a secondary toxicant and formulation aid in ATSB, and sucrose solution. Treatments were presented in tandem with unadulterated 10% sucrose in all assays. In both 24-h mortality and fecal droplet analysis, indoxacarb was ingested similarly as often as the sugar water-only control group and yielded the overall lowest mortality. Imidacloprid, λ-cyhalothrin, and abamectin were all readily ingested, and in some cases the fecal droplet analysis indicated bias towards consumption of the treated sugar solutions. Mortality in the first 24 h was over 95% for the aforementioned toxicants, supporting that they both kill in limited time and have a suitable palatability or repellency response profile with mosquitoes. But imidacloprid and λ-cyhalothrin (resistance) and imidacloprid (pollinators) have roadblocks for use in ATSB because of potential nontarget impact to pollinators and prevalent insecticide resistance issues. However, abamectin appears to be a promising ingredient for future ATSB formulations to establish quick vector interruption and improve insecticide class variety for resistance management.
40036643	Molecular Mechanism of λ-Cyhalothrin Detoxification by a Delta-Class Glutathione S-Transferase (PxGSTD3) from <i>Plutella xylostella</i>.	The diamondback moth (<i>Plutella xylostella</i>) exhibits significant resistance to commonly used insecticides including λ-cyhalothrin. Delta-class glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are crucial detoxification enzymes involved in insecticide detoxification and resistance. We demonstrate that <i>PxGSTD3</i> is associated with the resistance to λ-cyhalothrin and contributes to λ-cyhalothrin detoxification. The transcription of <i>PxGSTD3</i> was rapidly upregulated in response to λ-cyhalothrin exposure, and the recombinant protein exhibited significant metabolic activity against λ-cyhalothrin. Further investigation using computer-aided drug design revealed the binding and metabolic mechanism of PxGSTD3 toward λ-cyhalothrin. The results showed that λ-cyhalothrin binds to an active pocket through noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. Residues Arg36, Tyr115, and Phe119 were found to have a critical impact on the binding and metabolism of λ-cyhalothrin by PxGSTD3. These findings provide valuable insights into the metabolic role of GST in detoxifying insecticides and offer theoretical guidance for the design of novel pyrethroid-based insecticides.
40036624	Monitoring insecticide resistance and target-site mutations in field populations of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in China.	The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a notorious invasive pest, has been widely monitored for insecticide resistance. Since its invasion of China in late 2018, early to mid-stage monitoring of resistance is particularly crucial to inform effective control strategies. Resistance ratios (RRs) derived from bioassays offer valuable insights into the overall resistance levels of field populations, while the detection of resistance allele frequencies helps uncover the potential causes of resistance variation. In this study, we established a baseline of susceptibility in third-instar larvae to 7 insecticides using a laboratory strain Xinzheng2019 and assessed the resistance levels of 9 populations collected from central and southern China between 2022 and 2023. Compared to the susceptible Xinzheng2019 strain, 2 field populations showed low-level resistance (RR = 5-10) to indoxacarb, and one exhibited low-level resistance to chlorantraniliprole. Minor resistance (RR = 3-5) was observed in 2 populations to lambda-cyhalothrin, 5 to indoxacarb, and 5 to chlorantraniliprole. All populations remained susceptible (RR < 3) to spinetoram, emamectin benzoate, chlorfenapyr, and lufenuron. Molecular analysis of 11 mutation sites across 3 key resistance-related genes (Ace-1, GluCl, and voltage-gated sodium channel [VGSC]) revealed that 52.1% of all tested samples carried either homozygous or heterozygous resistance alleles at the F290V locus of the Ace-1 gene, while no resistance mutations were detected at other sites. Our findings offer valuable insights into the insecticide resistance status of S. frugiperda field populations in China and provide guidance for effective chemical insecticide use.
40036620	Machine-learning approach facilitates prediction of whitefly spatiotemporal dynamics in a plant canopy.	Plant-specific insect scouting and prediction are still challenging in most crop systems. In this article, a machine-learning algorithm is proposed to predict populations during whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci, Hemiptera; Gennadius Aleyrodidae) scouting and aid in determining the population distribution of adult whiteflies in cotton plant canopies. The study investigated the main location of adult whiteflies relative to plant nodes (stem points where leaves or branches emerge), population variation within and between canopies, whitefly density variability across fields, the impact of dense nodes on overall canopy populations, and the feasibility of using machine learning for prediction. Daily scouting was conducted on 64 non-pesticide cotton plants, focusing on all leaves of a node with the highest whitefly counts. A linear mixed-effect model assessed distribution over time, and machine-learning model selection identified a suitable forecasting model for the entire canopy whitefly population. Findings showed that the top 3 to 5 nodes are key habitats, with a single node potentially accounting for 44.4% of the full canopy whitefly population. The Bagging Ensemble Artificial Neural Network Regression model accurately predicted canopy populations (R² = 85.57), with consistency between actual and predicted counts (P-value > 0.05). Strategic sampling of the top nodes could estimate overall plant populations when taking a few samples or transects across a field. The suggested machine-learning model could be integrated into computing devices and automated sensors to predict real-time whitefly population density within the entire plant canopy during scouting operations.
40036334	PWC tool to estimate pesticide soil concentrations for risk assessment of non-target soil organisms.	In Brazil, as of 2024, regulatory authorities are discussing establishing new guidelines for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of Plant Protection Products (PPPs) for non-target soil organisms. A critical aspect of this process is exposure estimates of non-target soil organisms to PPPs. The present work investigates the potential application of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) modeling platform to estimate the Predicted Environmental Concentration in the soil (PECSOIL) as an option for exposure assessments. The objective of this exercise is to investigate the practicability and adaptability of PWC within the framework of a tiered risk assessment approach in Brazil. The PWC PECSOIL values were compared with two soil residue kinetics models: the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive PECSOIL Calculator and ESCAPE. As a validation step, PWC PECSOIL estimates were compared with measured soil residue data from two Brazilian locations. The impact of location-specific local data-soil physical-chemical properties, meteorological data, application methods, and crop parameters-on PECSOIL is also discussed, especially parameters which are inherent to PWC but absent in other soil kinetics calculators. Based on this work, we found the PWC model useful for soil exposure determination, especially when it becomes necessary to refine the exposure estimates using locally relevant conditions to bring more realism to the evaluation process.
40036312	Assessing pyrethroid resistance mechanisms in individual Culex tarsalis (Diptera: Culicidae).	The evolution of pyrethroid insecticide resistance in Culex tarsalis Coquillett, a vector for West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses, is a growing concern in Northern California. Common mechanisms of resistance include the target-site mutation, kdr, and increased levels of detoxification enzymes, such as mixed-function oxidases, GSTs, and esterases. The goal of this study was to compare the prevalence of kdr mutations (L1014F and L1014S) and detoxification enzymes between pyrethroid susceptible and resistant Cx. tarsalis individuals. Individual mosquitoes, categorized by resistance status from permethrin bottle bioassays, were prepared for both molecular and enzymatic testing by separating the legs of a mosquito from the remaining body. Legs were used to test for the presence of kdr mutations, while the bodies were used to test for the activity of detoxification enzymes. The number of phenylalanine (F) alleles present at the kdr target-site as well as levels of GST were increased in mosquitoes that survived the bottle bioassay compared to those that were knocked down. Individuals with 2 F alleles and an active GST level greater than or equal to 0.052 µg/ml showed a higher survival rate than either mechanism independently demonstrating resistance to pyrethroids in Cx. tarsalis is likely the result of multiple resistance mechanisms acting collectively. Further work is needed to determine the interplay of multiple resistance mechanisms to achieve phenotype resistance in this mosquito species.
40036185	Effects of soybean fields on the health of Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in the Chaco ecoregion.	Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are important pollinators for natural and cultivated species. Due to their high sensitivity to stressors, they are also valuable indicators of environmental changes and agricultural management practices. In this study, we compared the performance and incidence of pesticides over sentinel hives within forest remnants with those within linear forest fragments (LFF) surrounded by soybean fields under conventional management. Sentinel hives in LFF showed some signs of deterioration, such as colony collapse, low numbers of brood frames, and pesticide occurrences, but honey production and the number of adult bees were similar to hives in the forest. Soybean pollen was scarce in honey and absent in bee bread, suggesting that bees may be relying more on wild plant species. We detected 5 pesticides (azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, and coumaphos) in hives both at forests and LFF in pollen, bee bodies, and wax; pesticides in honey were detected in old sentinel hives (2 yr of exposition to agricultural conventional management). Only 2 of the 5 pesticides were applied in one of the farms under study, highlighting the importance of considering landscape-scale agricultural management. Our results indicate that conventional agriculture of soybean/maize primarily affected the performance of beehives, and pesticides were detected in honey only after long exposure to hives. Beekeeping in soybean fields in the Chaco could be feasible if cautions were followed, such as the conservation of forest fragments and key plant species, appropriate pesticide schedules, coordinated applications among farms, and linear forest remnants improvements.
40036018	Pyridaben as a novel fungicide against <i>Sphaerotheca fuliginea</i>, the causal agent of cucumber powdery mildew.	Pyridaben is a novel broad-spectrum insecticide and acaricide that is effective against thrips, mites, aphids and leafhoppers. We accidentally discovered that pyridaben was able to prevent cucumber powdery mildew. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects and underlying mechanisms of pyridaben against <i>Sphaerotheca fuliginea</i>. Pyridaben effectively inhibited the spore germination and mycelial growth of <i>S. fuliginea</i> with IC<sub>50</sub> of 10.83 mg/L and 18.28 mg/L, respectively. The spore germination, mycelial growth, and secondary spore formation of <i>S. fuliginea</i> was severely hindered on cucumber leaves treated with pyridaben at 20 mg/L. SEM revealed that the mycelia growing on pyridaben-treated cucumber leaves were much finer than that growing on untreated leaves. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that pyridaben had a significant impact on the ribosomal function and energy metabolism of the powdery mildew pathogen, restricting its normal physiological activities. In field experiments, the efficacies of pyridaben reached 76.48% in Zhejiang province and 78.40% in Shandong province at the rate of 225 g a.i./ha after two applications, which were comparable to the commercialized fungicides. These results suggest pyridaben is not only an insecticide but also an effective fungicide with the potential for further application in preventing and controlling cucumber powdery mildew.
40036017	Flutriafol Drench Provides Season-long Protection of Boxwood Plantings Pre-infected by <i>Calonectria pseudonaviculata</i> in the Mid-Atlantic.	Flutriafol drench application on March 7 without and with additional applications at 8- and 20-week intervals all consistently protected boxwood plantings pre-infected by Calonectria pseudonaviculata in two gardens in Richmond, Virginia through November 21. All drench applications were dosed at 2 ml product with 42% flutriafol and delivered in 250 ml solution per 30.5-cm shrub height in both gardens. While providing season-long protection, this drench dose also resulted in significant phytotoxicity on 30.5-cm tall 'Justin Brouwers' boxwood but not on English and common boxwood, which were 1.4 and 1.1 m tall, respectively. Once the phytotoxicity issue is resolved, only a single drench per year may suffice to protect boxwood plantings in the Mid-Atlantic, which would substantially cut the labor cost and minimize the health impacts commonly associated with current fungicide foliar sprays.
40035918	Characterization of plant growth-promoting endophytic fungi from Aegle marmelos Corr. and their role in growth enhancement and yield in rice.	Plant growth-promoting endophytes (PGPE) are microorganisms which reside in plant tissues and are beneficial to the host in plant growth promotion and pathogen resistance. They are the eco-friendly and sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This study aimed to analyze the plant growth-promoting properties of the five endophytic fungal strains from the medicinal plant Aegle marmelos Corr. and evaluate their effects on Oryza sativa plants. Firstly, endophytes were isolated from the different parts of A. marmelos and identified by ITS sequencing. Phosphate solubilization ability was checked in Pikovskaya's agar medium, IAA secretion was measured by the Salkowski colourimetric method, and ACC deaminase activity was checked by Penrose's method. Four endophytic fungal strains with promising PGP activities were inoculated into rice seeds to check their growth promotion in rice. The strain Purpureocillium lilacinum (AMR2) enhanced the seed vigour of rice seeds and demonstrated excellent root colonization ability. Periconia byssoides (AML2) and Medicopsis romeroi (AMS3) were the most effective plant growth-promoting agents, leading to both crop yield improvement and enhanced plant morphological growth due to their great ability to solubilize inorganic phosphate, ACC deaminase activity and production of IAA and Gibberellin A3 (GA3). These endophytic strains could serve as microbial inoculants to enhance crop production, offering an eco-friendly alternative.
40035808	Seaweed-based PPO inhibitors as a new frontier in biological weed control for sorghum cultivation: from ocean to field.	Weed management, particularly of broad-leaf species, poses a significant challenge in sorghum production, potentially causing up to 70.9% yield loss. Conventionally, herbicides are the site-specific weed inhibitors often used to suppress the growth of these weeds. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) is an important target for developing novel herbicides with remarkable selectivity against these broad-leaved weeds. In particular, saflufenacil is a selective PPO herbicide that can provide temporary relief. However, their prolonged use could lead to various environmental constraints and the evolution of resistant weeds. Recently, bioherbicides are emerging as an alternative to commercial herbicides with safer environmental profiles and combat resistance. On that note, this study aimed to identify novel and safer bioherbicides derived from seaweeds to outright bans on the use of most synthetic herbicides and address herbicide resistance. High-end computational screening strategies including molecular docking, binding free energy, in-house developed ML-based VS, and herbicide-likeness were used to pinpoint the lead molecule against the wild and mutant (∆G210) type AtPPO. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to validate the binding kinetics of the hit compound. Indeed, the bromophenol derivative BL003, isolated from brown algae, emerged as the hit compound from our analysis. Remarkably, BL003 demonstrated superior binding affinity and stability compared to saflufenacil against both wild-type AtPPO and the mutant AtPPO<sup>ΔG210</sup>. Thus, our findings could open new avenues for developing sustainable, seaweed-derived herbicides for sorghum cultivation. This research could contribute to the ongoing efforts to create environmentally friendly weed management solutions in agriculture.
40035488	Metabolomics as a Tool for Unraveling the Impact of Enantioselectivity in Cellular Metabolism.	Metabolomics is an emerging interdisciplinary field focused on the comprehensive analysis of all metabolites within biological samples, making it valuable for areas such as drug development, and environmental analysis. Many compounds, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals that have been extensively studied by metabolomics are chiral. The intrinsic chirality of biological targets can lead to a selective recognition of enantiomers resulting in distinct pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and/or toxicological profiles (enantioselectivity). Given that metabolomics captures an instant snapshot of an organism's metabolic state, it serves as a powerful tool to investigate chiral compounds and understand enantioselective effects. Herein, a systematic compilation of scientific literature was performed and 48 enantioselectivity studies using metabolomics were selected. These studies revealed an increasing focus on chiral pesticides (77%), the use of animal models (59%), reliance on LC-MS techniques (52%), and predominantly untargeted approaches (83%). Enantioselective effects were described in most studies. This review describes significant advances in this emerging field and highlights the use of metabolomics to unravel the role of stereochemistry in cellular metabolism by the examination of enantiomer-specific metabolic effects. Furthermore, it elucidates enantioselectivity mechanism that can be further applied to other groups of chiral compounds.
40035150	Precise genome editing of Dense and Erect Panicle 1 promotes rice sheath blight resistance and yield production in japonica rice.	The primary goals of crop breeding are to enhance yield and improve disease resistance. However, the "trade-off" mechanism, in which signalling pathways for resistance and yield are antagonistically regulated, poses challenges for achieving both simultaneously. Previously, we demonstrated that knock-out mutants of the Dense and Erect Panicle 1 (DEP1) gene can significantly enhance rice resistance to sheath blight (ShB), and we mapped DEP1's association with panicle length. In this study, we discovered that dep1 mutants significantly reduced rice yield. Nonetheless, truncated DEP1 was able to achieve both ShB resistance and yield increase in japonica rice. To further explore the function of truncated DEP1 in promoting yield and ShB resistance, we generated CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing mutants, including a full-length deletion mutant of DEP1, named dep1, and a truncated version, dep1-cys. Upon inoculation with Rhizoctonia solani, the dep1-cys mutant demonstrated stronger ShB resistance than the dep1 mutant. Additionally, dep1-cys increased yield per plant, whereas dep1 reduced it. Compared to the full DEP1 protein, the truncated DEP1 (dep1-cys) demonstrated a decreased interaction affinity with IDD14 and increased affinity with IDD10, which are known to positively and negatively regulate ShB resistance through the activation of PIN1a and ETR2, respectively. The dep1-cys mutant exhibited higher PIN1a and lower ETR2 expression than wild-type plants, suggesting that dep1-cys modulated IDD14 and IDD10 interactions to regulate PIN1a and ETR2, thereby enhancing ShB resistance. Overall, these data indicate that precise genome editing of DEP1 could simultaneously improve both ShB resistance and yield, effectively mitigating trade-off regulation in rice.
40035012	Residue determination and decline pattern of abamectin and fenpyroximate in okra fruits: a prelude to risk assessment.	This study developed and validated an LC-MS/MS analytical method for determining abamectin and fenpyroximate residues in okra fruits. The method optimization focused on chromatographic separation and ionization conditions, adding formic acid and ammonium formate to enhance ionization efficiency and signal sensitivity. Validation was performed according to SANTE guidelines, demonstrating good selectivity, linearity (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> > 0.998), precision, recovery, and minimal matrix effects (14.6% for abamectin and 5.2% for fenpyroximate). The limit of detection (LOD) was set at 0.0006 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for abamectin and 0.0002 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for fenpyroximate, while the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.002 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.001 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Precision was within acceptable limits, with intra-day RSD of 11.4% for abamectin and 7.6% for fenpyroximate. Recovery ranged from 84.2% to 98.6%, meeting the acceptable 70-120% range. Persistence studies indicated that abamectin and fenpyroximate residues dissipated over time, with half-lives of 2.3 and 2.45 days, respectively. The pre-harvest interval (PHI) required for residues to fall below the maximum residue limit (MRL) was estimated to be 2.6 days for abamectin and 6.9 days for fenpyroximate. The risk quotient was assessed based on the Egyptian adult consumers' consumption of okra, ensuring a negligible risk.
40035006	Metal oxides and their composites for the remediation of organic pesticides: advanced photocatalytic and adsorptive solutions.	Metal oxide nanoparticles and their composites have garnered significant attention in water treatment and environmental cleanup due to their unique physicochemical properties. These materials exhibit distinct crystalline structures, tunable morphologies, large surface areas, versatile surface chemistry, and widespread availability. These features make nanostructured metal oxides and their composites highly effective for the selective removal of organic pollutants from the environment, either by adsorption or photodegradation. This article focuses on recent advances, challenges, and opportunities in the use of metal oxides and their composites for the targeted removal of organic contaminants, including insecticides, phenolic compounds, organic dyes, and similar pollutants. The discussion encompasses a broad range of metal oxides and their composites, highlighting their diverse structural, crystallographic, and morphological characteristics that influence their adsorption and photocatalytic performance. Emphasis is placed on the photocatalytic and adsorptive capabilities of these materials, including their photo-stimulation properties and mechanisms. Metal oxides are highlighted as outstanding photocatalysts due to their high photodegradation efficiency, cost-effective synthesis methods, and optimized bandgap engineering. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers exploring the photocatalytic and adsorptive applications of metal oxide-based materials, particularly in the remediation of hazardous organic pollutants such as pesticides.
40034871	Thiamethoxam at environmentally relevant concentrations induces neurotoxicity in zebrafish larvae through binding with multiple receptors.	Thiamethoxam (THM) is one of the most widely used insecticides globally, which was designed to selectively target nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the insect nervous system and is generally considered safe for non-targeted organisms. However, increasing evidence has demonstrated its neurotoxicity in aquatic organisms, though the underlying mechanisms, especially at environmentally relevant concentrations, remain largely unclear. In this study, the swimming distance of zebrafish was significantly shortened by 14.06%-21.64% after exposure to THM at 10-1000 ng/L. This behavioral impairment may result from the damage to nervous and visual systems, as confirmed by notable apoptosis, histological analysis of the eyes, and differential expression of numerous genes. Molecular docking and biomarkers assays found that THM can bind with nAChR and multiple hormone receptors, with binding energies varying from -3.75 to -6.74 kcal/mol. Consequently, the concentrations of a neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) and related hormones (cortisol, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone) were significantly affected. Further investigations using a weighted gene correlation network and metabolomics suggest that THM may enter the cell via endocytosis and bind with multiple hormone receptors, potentially activating the MAPK signaling pathway. This activation may disrupt purine and pyrimidine metabolism in the cell nucleus, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis and neurotoxicity. This study reveals that THM, even at environmentally relevant concentrations, poses neurological risks to zebrafish and underscore the need for urgent attention to the ecological impacts of THM in aquatic environments.
40034316	Nanopesticides for managing primary and secondary stored product pests: Current status and future directions.	The preservation of agricultural commodities during storage is critical for ensuring food security and minimizing post-harvest losses. Both primary storage pests such as <i>Callosobruchus maculatus</i>, <i>Callosobruchus chinensis</i>, <i>Sitophilus weevils</i>, <i>Rhyzopertha dominica</i>, and <i>Trogoderma granarium</i>, and secondary storage pests like <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> cause significant damage to stored products, resulting in substantial economic losses. Traditional pest control methods, including chemical insecticides, face limitations due to environmental concerns and pest resistance. Consequently, nanoparticle-based insecticides are being extensively suggested as a promising alternative. This review analyzes the available literature on the efficacy of nanoparticles (NPs) against primary and some secondary storage pests. Green synthesis methods using plant extracts and other biological sources are highlighted for the production of environmentally friendly NPs. Studies demonstrate that NPs of alumina, carbon, silica, silver, copper, zinc oxide, nickel oxide, titanium dioxide, nano zeolite, as well as chitosan and polymers exhibit significant insecticidal activity against a variety of pests, in some cases surpassing mortality rates caused by traditional insecticides at recommended dosages. Structural, biochemical and molecular studies reveal that NPs induce oxidative stress, disrupt cellular homeostasis, and cause structural damage in pests. Histopathological evaluations indicate specific organ-related toxicity, emphasizing the need for comprehensive biosafety assessments. Additionally, the integration of NPs with conventional insecticides shows enhanced pest control efficiency, although challenges remain in standardizing synthesis methods and evaluating long-term environmental impacts. This review highlights the potential of NPs in sustainable pest management and underlines the importance of ongoing research to optimize specific formulations for specific groups of pests and ensure safety.
40034310	The importance of developing an integrated data-driven modelling platform for herbicide resistance research: A review.	Herbicide-resistant weeds pose a global challenge, constraining agricultural practices worldwide. Despite efforts to establish an integrated, data-driven framework, understanding the varied risks of herbicide resistance (HR) across different agroecological zones remains elusive. This review paper advocates for an integrated approach that incorporates socioeconomic, environmental, adoption behavior, and physiological factors to uncover insights into HR drivers and develop tailored management strategies. HR not only escalates production costs but also necessitates alternative weed management tactics, highlighting the urgency for proactive environmental management to mitigate soil health degradation and biodiversity loss. While current initiatives prioritize integrated weed management (IWM) like crop rotation and herbicide mixtures, challenges persist in integrating socioeconomic factors into predictive models and promoting the universal adoption of sustainable practices. Advancements in big data analytics, spatial modeling, and remote sensing offer promising avenues for predicting and managing HR across landscapes. This study proposes a research framework to predict the emergence and management of HR in agri-food systems. Additionally, the study utilizes a novel text-mining technique to conduct a comprehensive literature review, highlighting gaps in the development of data-driven modeling platforms for predicting HR emergence. The text mining findings explored that while common terms like weeds, resistance, herbicides, crops, management, and control are prevalent, research often lacks focus on predictive data-driven approaches for HR. Therefore, urgent development of an integrated national-scale approach to predict HR emergence is imperative. Global cooperation is essential for sharing best practices, data, and responses to emerging resistance threats.
40034099	Thiamethoxam Exposure Impairs Oocyte Maturation via Induction of Lipid Metabolism and Mitochondrial Dysfunctions in Porcine.	Neonicotinoid insecticides (NEOs) are the most widely used pesticides in modern agriculture, and there are residues in the environment and food. Thiamethoxam (TMX) has been proven to destroy the ovarian homeostasis of mice in vivo and reduce the development of porcine oocytes in vitro. However, whether TMX can interfere with porcine oocyte maturation and its potential mechanism remains unknown. This study indicated that TMX affects the expansion of cumulus cells, destroys the balance of lipid metabolism, and damages mitochondrial function. TMX treatment decreased the expression of genes related to cumulus cell expansion, lipid synthesis and mitochondrial synthesis. Collectively, results confirm that TMX exposure can damage oocyte maturation and produce reproductive toxicity by inducing lipid metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in porcine.
40033930	<i>UvCYP503</i> is required for stress response and pathogenicity in <i>Ustilaginoidea virens</i>.	The fungus <i>Ustilaginoidea virens</i>, which impacts rice spikes, causes rice false smut (RFS), a significant prevalent disease in rice cultivation regions globally. Cytochrome <i>P450</i> genes are known to be involved in secondary metabolism and pathogenesis in various species, but studies on <i>CYP450</i> genes in <i>U. virens</i> are limited. In this research, a <i>P450</i> family gene, <i>CYP503</i>, was found up-regulated during invasion stage of <i>U. virens</i>. Observation of fluorescence indicated that UvCYP503-GFP is situated within cytoplasm of hyphae. Disruption of <i>CYP503</i> led to decreased hyphal development, conidiation, and pathogenicity. Additional RNA-seq assay revealed that <i>UvCYP503</i> affects the transcript of genes associated with pathogenicity, various stress responses, and other <i>CYP450</i> genes. In alignment with RNA-seq results, compared with wild-type, Δ<i>Uvcyp503</i> mutants showed increased sensitivity to cell wall stresses, but reduced sensitivity to osmotic and hyperosmotic stressors. Moreover, Δ<i>Uvcyp503</i> mutants exhibited decreased sensitivity to the fungicides difenoconazole and tebuconazole. This study represents a phenome-based functional analysis of a <i>CYP503</i> gene in <i>U. virens</i> and provides valuable genetic resources for further research in filamentous fungi and other plant pathogens.
40033688	Effect of carbon chain length of cationic surfactants on regulating droplet behavior on peanut leaves.	Droplet rebound on superhydrophobic leaves during pesticide application significantly increases pesticide waste and decreases application efficiency. An appropriate surfactant is crucial for suppressing droplet rebound and enhancing wetting and spreading on leaf surfaces.
40033647	gma-miR828a Negatively Regulates Resistance to Tea Leaf Spot Caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae Through Targeting the CsMYB28-CsRPP13 Module.	Leaf spot caused by the fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae severely affects the quality and production of tea (Camellia sinensis) in plantations across southwestern China. Currently, no effective control measures are available, and the damage to tea leaves is also exacerbated by a lack of understanding regarding the epidemiology of the disease. Previous studies have suggested that gma-miR828a is differentially expressed during L. theobromae infection and may target and cleave the mRNA of CsMYB28. In this study, we characterised CsMYB28 as encoding a transcription factor (TF) that localises to the nucleus, cell membrane, and cytoplasm. This gene was found to be differentially and spatiotemporally expressed in leaf tissues following L. theobromae infection of leaves of the tea plant. Altered CsMYB28 expression, achieved by transient overexpression or stable genetic transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana, or transient silencing using antisense oligonucleotides (AsODN) in the tea plant, indicated that CsMYB28 contributes to resistance against L. theobromae. Using DNA affinity purification sequencing, yeast one-hybrid, and dual-luciferase assays, we also identified that CsMYB28 bound to the AATTAATT motif of CsRPP13, thereby activating the expression of CsRPP13. Additionally, degradome sequencing, β-glucuronidase (GUS) assays, and RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends revealed that miR828a cleaved CsMYB28 mRNA, negatively regulating its expression. The results from transient overexpression and stable transformation studies, combined with AsODN-mediated silencing in the tea plant, suggested that miR828a plays a negative regulatory role in modulating the response of the tea plant to L. theobromae infection. This study demonstrates that the miR828a-CsMYB28-CsRPP13 mediates the response of the tea plant to L. theobromae infection.
40033574	Design, synthesis and biological activity evaluation of novel imidazo[5,1-b]thiazole derivatives containing a pyrazole ring based on the intermediate derivatization method.	A substantial amount of empirical research indicates that the development of novel pesticides through the intermediate derivatization method can significantly enhance the success rate of new pesticide creation while reducing research and development costs. In response to this demand, a series of novel derivatives containing pyrazole imidazo[5,1-b]thiazole were synthesized by the intermediate derivatization method to modify the imine skeleton, which was found to have good antifungal activity in a previous work, and subjecting it to intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction.
40033284	Impact of dual active ingredients long-lasting insecticidal nets on the genetic structure of insecticide resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae in Southern Benin.	Insecticide resistance amongst vector populations is a major challenge, exacerbated by the continued use of the same active ingredients. The present study assessed the impact of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) bi-treated with chlorfenapyr-alphacypermethrin (PY-CFP LLIN) or pyriproxyfen-alphacypermethrin (PY-PPF LLIN) on the genetic structure of resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae in 60 clusters divided into three arms from three districts in southern Benin.
40032875	Synergistic effects of herbicides and gibberellic acid on wheat yield and quality.	Gibberellic acid (GA<sub>3</sub>) is commercially applied to stimulate the growth and productivity of various agricultural crops. However, its impact on the yield and chemical properties of wheat under weed stress is still unclear. In this investigation, the influence of weed control (sulfosulfuron (sulfo-s), florasulam 7.5% + flumetsulam 10% (derby), pyroxsulam (pallas), and untreated check) and GA<sub>3</sub> (0, 100, and 200 mg/L) treatments on the narrow-leaved weed (i.e., Avena fatua L.) and broad-leaved weeds as well as yield and chemical properties of wheat (cv. Sakha 94) was explored. The findings showed that the wheat plants were infested by seven weed species. Such weeds were notably controlled using herbicidal treatments, particularly annual sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.) (94.1 and 92.0%) and field binder (Convolvulus arvensis L.) (91.5 and 93.6%) were very highly susceptible to pallas herbicide in both seasons. Likened to control group, the application of GA<sub>3</sub> (especially at 200 mg/L) or pallas herbicide observably decreased the dry weight of wild oat (Avena fatua L.) and broad-leaved weeds, which contributed positively to the increase of plant height, No. of spikelet's/spike, 1000-grain weight, and grain yield (P < 0.05) in both seasons. Moreover, spraying of sulfo-s herbicide maximized spike length of wheat plants (16.0 cm) in the 2<sup>nd</sup> season, whereas plots treated with derby had the highest spike weight (7.64 and 7.17 g) and No. of grains/spike (62.0 and 58.8) in two seasons. Furthermore, the maximal grain yield was recorded following the synergistic spraying of pallas and GA<sub>3</sub> at 200 mg/L (7278 kg/ha in the 1st season) as well as sulfo-s and GA<sub>3</sub> at 200 mg/L (6935 kg/ha in the 2nd season). Relative to control, significant increases in protein (by 46.99 and 50.47%) and nitrogen content (by 46.93 and 50.54%) were also noticed after the use of derby and 200 mg/L GA<sub>3</sub> in 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> season, respectively (P < 0.05), implying the improvement in the quality of wheat grains. Most remarkably, Pearson's correlation demonstrated that the reduction in Avena fatua L. and broad-leaved weeds was accountable strongly for 66 to 96% of the enhancement in yield and chemical properties of wheat under the application of herbicides and GA<sub>3</sub> treatments. The current findings may be very relevant in guiding farmers in the selection of suitable agronomic treatments (i.e., herbicides and GA<sub>3</sub>) that may maximize wheat yield and quality.
40032465	Residual behaviors and health risk assessment of dinotefuran, flonicamid, and their metabolites during apple growth, storage, and processing.	Understanding the fate of dinotefuran, flonicamid, and their metabolites is crucial for accurate dietary exposure assessment and human health. The dissipation and removal of dinotefuran, flonicamid, and their metabolites from apple cultivation to consumer's plate were studied. The results of field and storage experiments indicated significant differences in half-life at different doses. And the half-life was shorter in the field than that in storage. During washing, the residues of all target compounds were decreased. Among washing solutions, the PF values of each pesticide gradually decreased with the increasing washing time and washing solution concentration. 2 % NaHCO<sub>3</sub> produced best removal effect after washing 15 min. Various food processing techniques, including peeling, fermentation, clarification, blanching, drying, enzymolysis, and simmering, were used to confirm the most effective way to remove these target compounds. For majority processes, the PF values were < 1, and the peeling and fermentation could obviously reduce pesticide residues. The risk quotients were < 100 %, implying that the risks were acceptable. This study provided a necessary information for the use of pesticides in apple cultivation and improvement of processing technology to ensure food safety.
40032461	Integrative transcriptomic and HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis reveals the influence mechanism of different altitude ecotypes on pulp aroma components and volatile metabolites in strawberry hybrid F<sub>1</sub> and its parents.	Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) is an important horticultural crop and is highly nutritious and valuable. However, several molecular mechanisms on the biosynthesis and metabolism of aroma compounds and the regulatory network that governs aromas remain unknown. This study investigated the influence of different altitude ecotypes on the components of pulp aroma and volatile metabolites in strawberry hybrid F<sub>1</sub> and its parents. "Perilla alcohol" was found to be the major factor that regulated the aroma of strawberry pulp from plants at low altitudes, and "perilla alcohol, linalool, alpha-farnesene and E-2-hexenyl benzoate" were the major factors that regulated the aroma of strawberry pulp from plants at high altitudes. Furthermore, three key candidate genes were identified according to the criteria of |K.i| > 40 and |MM| > 0.90. This study will establish a theoretical foundation for the cultivation of novel varieties of strawberries characterized by superior quality and flavor.
40032454	Assessing the differential responses in normal and inflamed in vitro intestinal models exposed to food contaminants complex mixtures.	The intestinal barrier is crucial for gut health, and its dysfunction can lead to chronic inflammatory conditions. Food contaminants like pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins, heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may worsen these conditions. However, research often overlooks the complex interactions between contaminants and the different cells in the intestine. This study explores the effects of repeated exposure to a mixture of 45 food contaminants on a triculture cell model (Caco-2/HT29-MTX monolayers and THP-1 cells) under normal and inflamed conditions. Two exposure scenarios were tested: a low-level mixture (LOW) reflecting daily diet exposure and a worst-case (WS) scenario. Cytotoxicity, barrier integrity, the expression of inflammation, oxidative stress, and intestinal barrier-related genes, as well as intestinal compounds absorption, were assessed. LOW and WS tested mixtures were confirmed to be non-cytotoxic to the monolayer. The inflamed model was validated with a 23 % reduction in TEER value compared to the normal. The WS mixture caused a maximum TEER decrease of 61 % after repeated exposure. The inflamed model was more vulnerable to contaminants, though the normal also showed significant effects. Gene expression revealed modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress, indicating that even real-life levels of food contaminants exacerbate these responses. The WS mixture induced 6-8 times the expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in contaminants absorption between the models, but the absorption patterns align with known data. These findings enhance understanding of the intestinal effects of exposure to food contaminant mixtures in the diet.
40032241	The bacterial symbionts of Entomopathogenic nematodes and their role in symbiosis and pathogenesis.	Entomopathogenic bacteria in the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus are mutualistically associated with entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) Steinernema and Heterorhabditis, respectively. Together they form an insecticidal partnership which has been shown to kill a wide range of insect species. The spectrum of dependence in this symbiotic partnership is diverse, ranging from a tight, obligate relationship to a facultative one. A body of evidence suggests that the reproductive fitness of the nematode-bacterium partnership is tightly associated and interdependent. Furthermore, maintenance of their virulence is also critical to the conversion of the insect host as a suitable environment where this partnership can be perpetuated. Disruption of the symbiotic partnership can have detrimental effects on the fitness of both partners. The nematode-bacterial symbiont-insect partnership represents a model system in ecology and evolutionary biology and amenable to investigate beneficial and antagonistic interactions between invertebrates and microbes. Furthermore, the EPN's bacterial symbionts are also viewed as a model system to study the biosynthesis, structure and function of various natural products. Their ability to produce up to 25 different natural product classes is outstanding among the Morganellaceae. These natural products show biological activity, most likely originating from important functions during the life cycle of both the nematodes and their symbionts. Tools and high throughput technologies have been developed to identify ubiquitous and rare molecules and study their function and assess their potential as novel biological activities. We herein summarize the symbiotic relationship between EPN and their bacterial symbionts, focusing on their fitness and their ability to successfully access and utilize an insect host. We also recapitulate the history of natural products research highlighting recent findings and the synthetic biology approaches that are currently implemented to identify non-natural derivatives from Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus with improved biological activity.
40032182	Imidazolium salt as potent Amoebicide for rapid inactivation of Acanthamoeba spp. trophozoites and cysts.	Acanthamoeba spp. are amphizoic protozoa capable of causing several severe diseases in humans and other animals, including granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK). The high resistance of Acanthamoeba genus, especially in its cystic form, to most conventional disinfectants poses a challenge for its management through aseptic practices based on chemical disinfectants. The imidazolium salt (IS) (C<sub>16</sub>MImCl) demonstrated significant acanthamoebicidal potency against both trophozoites and cysts. However, its biocidal efficacy over a short exposure time, which will shed light on its potential use as a disinfectant, still needs to be studied. Therefore, the acanthamoebicidal effect of IS against trophozoites and cysts of Acanthamoeba polyphaga and Acanthamoeba spp. exposed for 5 and 20 min to concentrations of 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62, and 7.81 μg/mL was evaluated in the present study. Exposure of trophozoites of both strains to IS for 20 min significantly reduced trophozoite viability at concentrations ≥62.5 μg/mL. All trophozoites of both strains were inactived 20 min after cessation of IS exposure at concentrations of ≥125 μg/mL for 5 min or ≥15 μg/mL for 20 min. Cyst viability of all strains was significantly reduced after 20 min of exposure to IS at 62.5 and 125 μg/mL, based on the viability exclusion assay with trypan blue dye. However, all cysts exposed to IS at ≥ 125 μg/mL for 20 or 5 min were unable to excyst when incubated for 10 days on non-nutrient agar with Escherichia coli. The acanthamoebicidal efficacy of IS, upon short exposure to concentrations below the cytotoxic value for human keratinocyte cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 171.50 μg/mL), combined with its previously reported bactericidal and fungicidal effects, suggests that IS has the potential to be used in the formulation of multipurpose disinfectants.
40032026	Reinforcement learning-based generative artificial intelligence for novel pesticide design.	Pesticides play a pivotal role in ensuring food security, and the development of green pesticides is an inevitable trend in global agricultural progress. Although deep learning-based generative models have revolutionized de novo drug design in pharmaceutical research, their application in pesticide research and development remains unexplored.
40032022	Assessment of pesticide contamination in pomegranates: A multivariate approach and health risk evaluation.	Pesticide residues in pomegranates pose a significant food safety concern, particularly given the rising global consumption of this fruit. This study monitored 316 pesticide residues in 342 pomegranate samples from Turkey's three primary pomegranate production regions using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Pesticide residues were detected in 72.8% of the samples, with 40 different pesticides identified, 15 of which were unauthorized. Spirotetramat, acetamiprid, and fludioxonil were among the most frequently detected, with concentrations exceeding the maximum residue levels set by the European Union in 40.6% of the contaminated samples. Multivariate analysis revealed strong correlations between specific pesticide pairs, suggesting common usage patterns. The chronic hazard index was 0.0132 for adults and 0.0403 for children, indicating no significant chronic health risks. The acute health risks for all pesticides remained below acceptable limits, except for acetamiprid, which exceeded the threshold (1.186) for children. However, the presence of non-approved pesticides, such as omethoate, raises concerns about regulatory compliance. Continued surveillance and risk assessment are essential to minimize potential health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations consuming pomegranates.
40031394	Spatiotemporal distribution and potential ecological risks of current-use pesticides (CUPs) in Laizhou Bay, China.	Pesticides occur widely in coastal waters and potentially pose a risk to marine ecosystems and human health. The spatiotemporal distribution of current-use pesticides (CUPs) was studied in Laizhou Bay (LZB) and the Xiaoqing River watershed in China during the summer of 2022 and spring of 2023. The pesticide composite index (PCI) and persistence index (PI) were established in association with the risk quotient (RQ) to assess the ecological risk in LZB. In this study, 17 and 12 kinds of CUP were detected in rivers and LZB seawater, respectively, with atrazine and neonicotinoid insecticides (NEOs) being the most frequently detected CUPs at higher concentrations. The average concentration of CUPs decreased from rivers to the coast and towards the center of the LZB, with higher levels in spring and lower levels in summer in rivers and a reversed pattern in seawater. The high-risk areas lie in the LZB coastal area and the estuary. Atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and imidacloprid might pose a high risk to aquatic organisms based on the RQ in the LZB, whereas the priority concern pesticides are atrazine and triazophos based on the PCI and PI. This study is of great significance for assessing the composite ecological risk of CUPs in aquatic environments.
40031084	Boron dipyrromethene fungicide for anti-microbial photodynamic therapeutics.	Due to inadequate light transmission into the subsurface, one of the key challenges for conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) is realizing successful treatment of deep-skin pathogenetic bacterial infectious wounds. Preparation of near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizers (PSs) with potent antibacterial activity is a potential solution to address this issue. In the present work, a boron dipyrromethene (BDP) derivative was synthesized, which had red light absorption and NIR fluorescence. Under 635 nm of irradiation, BDP could generate massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) for sterilization, which exhibited robust photodynamic antiseptic property against Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus), with a minimum inhibitory concentration of only 240 nM (140 mW cm <sup>-2</sup>). More importantly, BDP was capable of efficiently suppressing the development of bacterial biofilms and even eliminate established biofilms, thereby facilitating the enhancement of sterilizing efficacy. Furthermore, the promising antibacterial capability of BDP was validated in the treatment of S. aureus-infected abscess. The present work presents an antibiotic-free strategy for highly effective light-triggered abscess therapy.
40029986	Discovery of Novel Pyrazole/Thiazole Derivatives Containing Cyano/Thiocyanato Groups as Fungicide Candidates.	The introduction of groups with high drug activity is an effective strategy for discovering novel succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides, providing insights for the future design of SDHI fungicides with higher efficacy and resistance. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of novel pyrazole/thiazole derivatives containing cyano/thiocyanato groups and evaluated them for antifungal activity. Some of the designed compounds exhibited promising antifungal activities against tested fungi, among them, compounds <b>B31</b> and <b>B35</b> displayed excellent <i>in vitro</i> activity against <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.83 and 1.08 μg/mL, which were in close proximity to the commercial fungicide boscalid (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.87 μg/mL). For <i>Altemaria solani</i>, compound <b>B35</b> (11.14 μg/mL) showed good antifungal activity against <i>Altemaria solani</i> with EC<sub>50</sub> values below boscalid (15.31 μg/mL). SAR studies further reveal that induced and conjugated interactions between <b>B35</b> and the target receptor facilitate an electron transport process, contributing to its antifungal activity. In preliminary mechanistic studies, compound <b>B35</b> induced the mycelium and cells of <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> showed irregular abnormal state under SEM and TEM observation and caused the production and accumulation of ROS. Molecular docking results and SDH enzyme assays indicate that compound <b>B35</b> has the potential to be an effective SDHI fungicide.
40029859	Assessing the potential for fall armyworm exchanges between the two American continents across the Mexico-Central America land bridge.	The fall armyworm is a major agricultural pest of corn and multiple other crops. A native of the Western Hemisphere it is now a global concern after its discovery in Africa in 2016 and subsequent infestations in Asia and Australia. A defining characteristic of fall armyworm is its capacity for long distance migration, first documented for populations in North America and assumed to occur elsewhere. This trait increases the risk that phenotypes harmful to agriculture, such as pesticide resistance, that arise in one location can rapidly disseminate to even geographically distant populations. This study examines the extent to which the Mexico-Central America land bridge serves as a pathway for gene flow between the fall armyworm from the two American continents. The work builds on previous surveys in Mexico that suggest possible geographical or meteorological barriers limiting mass population movements. Fall armyworm collections from Mexico were analyzed for patterns of genetic variation and these were correlated with modeling of climate suitability, the locations of major corn production, and wind-dependent dispersal projections. Significant but transient genetic structure was found in Mexico consistent with climate suitability and air transport projections that support localized dispersal behavior rather than long-distance movements. The results indicate the movement of fall armyworm through Mexico does not involve migratory movements of mass populations as observed in the United States. This suggests that the exchange of fall armyworm between the two Americas across the Central America land bridge is limited in scope and frequency.
40029504	CO<sub>2</sub> Fixation into Useful Aromatic Carboxylic Acids via C (sp<sup>2</sup>)-X Bonds Functionalization.	Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is an abundant and readily available carbon source. Its transformation into high-added-value chemicals is a beneficial strategy, which mitigates greenhouse gas emissions and provides new raw material sources for the chemical industry. Among these chemicals, the aromatic carboxylic acids and derivatives have broad applications in medicine, pesticides, and materials science. Therefore, the carboxylation of C(sp<sup>2</sup>)-X (X = metal, halide, H, O, or S) bonds with CO<sub>2</sub> to efficiently construct aromatic carboxylic acids and their derivatives is a synthetic strategy of significance. This review highlights the recent progress in constructing carboxylic acids and derivatives through the carboxylation of C(sp<sup>2</sup>)-X bonds with CO<sub>2</sub> including literature published from 2000 to December 2024.
40029467	Tactical metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) adsorbent advantages in removal applications.	Water pollution caused by the increasing concentration of toxic chemicals, such as heavy metal ions, pesticides, pharmaceutical waste, and plastic contaminants, has become a global issue. The rising levels of these pollutants pose significant health risks to humans and various species. Recently, adsorption has emerged as a promising method for removing these contaminants. This review focuses on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as adsorbents, highlighting their large surface areas and adjustable porosity, which optimize the adsorption process. The review analyzes the active sites within MOFs, their roles in adsorption mechanisms, and the underlying chemistry involved. It also discusses the structural chemistry of MOFs and its impact on pollutant removal efficiency. Furthermore, the review addresses stability, scalability, and economic feasibility challenges. Finally, it suggests future research directions for next-generation MOF materials to enhance their effectiveness in sustainable environmental remediation, ultimately improving our ability to combat contamination issues and protect healthy ecosystems.
40029441	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated efficient PlCYP81Q38 mutagenesis in Phryma leptostachya.	Combined with hairy root transformation, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was established to initiate targeted mutagenesis of PlCYP81Q38, which influenced lignan accumulation in Phryma leptostachya. Phryma leptostachya is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb renowned for its applications in both conventional medicine and natural botanical insecticides, with lignans as the main active ingredients. During the biosynthesis of lignans, PlCYP81Q38, a P450 protein, is assumed to play a crucial role and is accountable for the production of sesamin from (+)-pinoresinol. As a cutting-edge genome editing tool, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is widely employed across diverse species for gene functional research but yet to be harnessed in P. leptostachya. This study utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system in conjunction with hairy root transformation to initiate targeted mutagenesis in PlCYP81Q38 gene. Employing binary vectors, pYLCRISPR/Cas9Pubi-H, complemented by dual single-stranded guided RNAs (sgRNAs), enabled precise editing at two gene sites and the deletion of large fragments. This editing system resulted in mutagenesis rates surpassing 79%, achieving a notable rate of 61.9% fragment deletion mutants. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the impact on lignan biosynthesis by PlCYP81Q38-targeted mutagenesis, resulting in the accumulation of pinoresinol and disrupted production of sesamin, 6-demethoxy-leptostachyol acetate, and leptostachyol acetate. Furthermore, the knockout of PlCYP81Q38 up-regulated its upstream pathway genes, such as dirigent gene, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase genes, cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase genes, and p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase genes, identified through gene co-expression analysis. Collectively, mediated by the CRISPR/Cas9 platform, the new biotechnology for targeted genome editing within P. leptostachya, our findings affirm the significant roles of PlCYP81Q38 in the lignan biosynthesis pathway and highlight the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 in exploring the functional genome and secondary metabolite biosynthesis of this plant species.
40029259	Subacute genotoxicity of acetamiprid in somatic cells of Swiss albino male mice.	Pesticides are applied to plants all over the world to boost food production and lower the spread of diseases carried by insects. Exposure to the pesticides may cause genotoxic effects on target and non-target organisms, including humans. In agriculture, acetamiprid (ACE), a neonicotinoid insecticide, is frequently applied either alone or in conjunction with other pesticides. A combined approach employing the micronucleus test (MNT) and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) assay was used to evaluate the genotoxic effects of acetamiprid in the bone marrow of male Swiss albino mice. Acetamiprid was administered i.p. daily at 4.6 and 2.3 mg/kg/day along with 3% gum acacia as a negative control for 30 days. ACE treatment resulted in a small dose dependent increase in the frequencies of micronuclei per cell (0.28 ± 0.04, 0.38 ± 0.03, and 0.45 ± 0.02 for the control, 2.3 and 4.6 mg/kg b.wt. groups, respectively) and chromosomal aberrations (3.67 ± 0.61, 5.00 ± 0.45, and 7.00 ± 1.43 for the control, 2.3 and 4.6 mg/kg b.wt. groups, respectively) in bone marrow cells, but no significant differences were observed between these data sets. In conclusion, daily i.p. exposure of ACE @ 2.3 and 4.6 mg/kg b.wt. for 30 days did not produce significant genotoxic effects in the somatic cells of Swiss albino male mice.
40028880	Covalently Bound MOF/COF Aerogels as Robust Catalytic Filters for Rapid Nerve Agent Decomposition.	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show promising results in various fields, such as gas separation and catalysis, but they face limitations due to problems associated with their low processability. This study addresses these challenges by utilizing postsynthetic modification (PSM) of NH<sub>2</sub>-UiO-66 and NH<sub>2</sub>-MOF-808 with 1,3,5-benzene tricarbaldehyde (BTCA) to form hybrid aerogels consisting of MOF-loaded covalent organic framework (COF). BTCA-modified MOF nanoparticles via imine bond formation were confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, FTIR, and solid-state <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopies. MOF/COF composites were analyzed via TGA, PXRD, BET, and solid-state <sup>13</sup>C NMR, showing retained crystallinity and increased porosity in comparison to the sum of the individual components. Moreover, improved aerogel mechanical properties and increased MOF loading of up to 75 wt % were achieved for covalently bound aerogels. Hybrid aerogel composites were successfully utilized as catalytic filters for the decomposition of nerve agent simulant and pesticide dimethyl-4-nitrophenylphosphate (DMNP), avoiding secondary pollution associated with MOF powder catalysis.
40028791	The relationship between the Huanglongbing pathogen and Diaphorina citri with body color polyphenism: field dynamics, acquisition efficiency, and immunity response.	Phenotypic plasticity is generally regarded as a crucial adaptation that enables organisms to survive in the face of environmental changes. Diaphorina citri, a vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) that causes citrus Huanglongbing, displays three distinct body color morphotypes: blue/green, gray/brown, and orange/yellow morphs. Here, dynamics monitoring of D. citri population in the field was established to identify the occurrence peak. The orange/yellow is a shared phenotype, and hence we focused on the two most prevalent color morphs blue/green and gray/brown. We evaluated the life-history characteristics and susceptibility to insecticides of the two color morphs. For the association between the body color polyphenism and CLas, we compared the CLas acquisition efficiency of field and laboratory populations, and investigated immunological competence of the two color morphs.
40028677	The plant Diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase uses spermidine as its amino donor.	Biotin is an essential vitamin that is only synthesised in microorganisms, plants and fungi, so the biosynthetic pathway is of interest for antibacterial and herbicide discovery. Plants contain a single, bifunctional enzyme that catalyses two sequential steps in biotin biosynthesis, dethiobiotin synthetase-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase (herein referred to as BioDA). Diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase (BioA) catalyses the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination of 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid to produce 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid, while dethiobiotin synthetase (BioD) catalyses the subsequent step to produce dethiobiotin. In contrast to plants, in bacteria, these activities are catalysed by two separate enzymes, BioA and BioD. Most bacterial BioA enzymes use an unusual amino donor, S-adenosyl methionine, while other BioA enzymes use lysine as the amino donor. We show that the plant BioA uses spermidine as the amino donor. Spermidine binding and aminotransferase activity is stimulated by bicarbonate by an interaction with Arg 797 that is assumed to be a carbamate derivative of spermidine. We confirm a previous observation that cadaverine is a weak inhibitor of BioA, indicating that cadaverine can modulate biotin biosynthesis.
40028603	Climatic drivers for assessment of false smut risk in rice ecosystems: A guide for planning effective management trials.	Emergence of false smut (RFS) in rice agroecosystems is causing significant yield losses due to its direct impact on grains. To assess the factors associated with host-pathogen interaction, maximum entropy principle is used to identify bioclimatic variables behind the geo-spatial distribution patterns of RFS. Bioclimatic variables with ecological significance, derived from the monthly temperature and precipitation, such as precipitation in the wettest month, mean temperature of the warmest quarter and precipitation seasonality are linked to the occurrence of the disease. These three variables are identified as the strongest predictors of RFS distribution contributing 47.81 %, 26.63 % and 12.43 % respectively. Seasonal precipitation and its variability have played as a limiting factor for the disease. Temperature plays a crucial role in pathogen growth and development (mycelial growth, sclerotial germination and infection) and exerts influences on disease distribution. Spatial distribution pattern of the disease and its intensity, as well as the number of sclerotia/panicle development, germination and infection suitability, suggest that temperature response and daily precipitation during the booting stage have a significant impact on disease development. Number of favourable days composed of temperature response [<i>f(T)</i> > 20] and daily rainfall (>5 mm) is noted to be proportional to the RFS incidence (infected grains/panicle). RFS distribution pattern validated through ground truth data is noted to have a correspondence with rainfall pattern during the wettest month (June-Sep). The rainfall-induced monocyclic infection process at known stage of crop growth is implicated for evaluation of management options as effective fungicides are available.
40028591	Integrated Pest Management techniques in a Kinnow mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i> Blanco) orchard with an emphasis on yield improvement.	Kinnow mandarin (<i>Citrus reticulata</i> Blanco) is a valuable fruit crop mainly grown in the North Indian states of India due to its high-quality juice content. Psylla (<i>Diaphorina citri</i> Kuwayama), whitefly (<i>Dialoeurodes citri</i> Ashmead), sooty mould (<i>Capnodium citri</i>) and dieback (<i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>) pests are the most important biotic constraints affecting its fruit yield up to 70 percent. To manage these pests, farmers often use mixture of non-label claim pesticides (quinalphos 25%EC, lambda-cyhalothrin 2.5%EC, diafenthiuron 50%WP, chlorantraniliprole 18.5 %, cymoxanil 8 % + mancozeb 64 % WP, etc.) without achieving the desired effect. Hence, area-wide implementation of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy in Kinnow mandarin was implemented during 2021-2023 covering 5 villages at Hisar, Haryana. Among the IPM strategy, installing yellow sticky traps @ 20/ha, neem seed kernel extract spray @ 5 %, and imidacloprid 17.8SL @ 0.3 % reduced the whitefly and psylla populations. The spray of 1 % starch and dipping infected fruits in a bleaching solution @ 0.1 % reduced the severity of sooty mould disease. Pruning and destruction of dead twigs followed by a spray of copper oxychloride 50 WP @ 0.3 % were found very effective too. The lowest average population of psylla and whitefly were recorded in T<sub>1</sub>-IPM compared to T<sub>2</sub>-farmer practice and T<sub>3</sub>-control, respectively. Minimum average disease severity of sooty mould and dieback was noticed in T<sub>1</sub>-IPM compared to T<sub>2</sub>-farmer practice while the highest disease severity was recorded in T<sub>3</sub>-control. Population dynamics of psylla, whitefly and sooty mould, dieback severity, and Area Under Diseases Progress Curve (AUDPC) were found to vary during 11th to 52nd standard meteorological week (SMW). They were observed to be highest in T<sub>3</sub>-control treatment, followed by T<sub>2</sub>-farmer practice and T<sub>1</sub>-IPM. The highest natural enemy's populations (Coccinellid, <i>Chrysoperla,</i> and spider) were recorded in T<sub>3</sub>-control followed by T<sub>1</sub>-IPM, and then in T<sub>2</sub>-farmer practice treatment. The highest average fruit yield and B: C ratio was recorded in T<sub>1</sub>-IPM compared to T<sub>2</sub>-farmer practice and T<sub>3</sub>-control treatment. The validated IPM strategies can be adopted by Kinnow mandarin growing farmers as an economically viable option for the management of psylla, whitefly, sooty mould, and dieback pests.
40028456	Characterization of green-synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles and its influence on post-harvest shelf-life of garlic against black mold disease caused by <i>Aspergillus niger</i>.	Garlic is an important spice crop used for flavoring food and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. However, black mold is a common fungal disease affecting garlic, which was caused by an <i>Aspergillus</i> infection. This disease significantly impacts both the production and quality of garlic. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the antifungal activity of novel green-synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) against black mold diseases in garlic. An environmentally friendly green synthesis technique was used to produce ZnO-NPs using zinc-tolerant bacteria <i>Serratia</i> sp. (ZTB24). In the present study the experimental analysis viz. UV-Vis spectroscopy at 380 nm, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential confirmed the successful biosynthesis of green ZnO-NPs from <i>Serratia</i> sp. The poisoned food technique and spore germination test revealed the antifungal activities of ZnO-NPs against <i>A. niger</i> under <i>in vitro</i> conditions. The presence of disease-causing <i>A. niger</i> fungus was confirmed through its isolation from infected garlic bulbs, and it was further identified at the molecular level using inter-transcribed sequence (ITS) rDNA sequencing. ZnO-NPs reduced the mycelial growth up to 90% and the 73% spore germination at 250 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> concentration of ZnO-NPs. The ZnO-NPs were further used <i>in vivo</i> at different concentrations (50, 100, 250, and 500 ppm) in the post-harvest treatment of garlic. The percentage of disease severity was assessed after 7 and 14 days, and the application of 500 ppm of ZnO-NPs exhibited 0% disease severity in the pre-inoculation method, while disease severity of black mold disease in garlic plant was recorded at 1.10% after 7 days and 0.90% after 14 days in the post-inoculation method, compared to the control group. Hence, the antifungal activity of ZnO-NPs synthesized using the green technique paves the way for the development of natural fungicides, offering a sustainable and renewable alternative to traditional chemical control methods.
40028192	Research on the influence of g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> microstructure changes on the efficiency of visible light photocatalytic degradation.	The structural modulation of pristine graphitic carbon nitride poses a considerable challenge in the rational design of catalysts for the efficient degradation of small organic pollutants under visible light. In this study, we combined first-principles calculations and the structure-function relationship to predict a high-performance catalyst. The results reveal that CN-8 demonstrates a remarkable degree of electron-hole separation. Notably, CN-8 shows exceptional degradation efficiency towards rhodamine B, tetracycline, bisphenol A, and fluralaner under visible light irradiation. Specifically, the degradation rate constants are 11, 4, 12, and 32 times higher, respectively, compared to bulk g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Through density functional theory calculations and investigations of the structure-function relationship, it is confirmed that the superior catalytic activity of CN-8 lies in modifying the amino position, which alters the electron cloud distribution and promotes the efficient separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. This study provides valuable insights for the development of eco-friendly and efficient photocatalysts for environmental remediation.
40028089	Toxicity of Pentachlorophenol Exposure on Male and Female <i>Heteropneustes fossilis</i> Investigated Using NMR-Based Metabolomics Approach.	Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is one of the most common chlorophenols utilized in numerous industrial processes, including the production of dyes, pesticides, wood preservatives, disinfectants, antiseptics, and medicines because it has fungicidal and bactericidal characteristics. Previous studies on catfish (<i>Heteropneustes fossilis</i>) revealed that PCP acts as a potent endocrine disruptor and also causes behavioral changes in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the toxicological effects of PCP have not been compared between male and female catfish. The present study aims to investigate the toxic effects of PCP on catfish through histopathological changes, oxidative stress, and serum metabolomics after 60 days of exposure. Chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of PCP resulted in significant histopathological alterations in the liver and gonad, including leukocyte infiltration, hepatocyte degeneration, follicular layer dissolution, and abnormal sperm distribution. Increased levels of lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide, along with decreased antioxidant enzyme activity, were observed in PCP-exposed groups. A <sup>1</sup>H NMR-based metabolomics approach was employed to investigate the toxic effects of PCP on catfish serum, revealing alterations in various metabolites, including amino acids, organic acids, glucose, cholesterol, and neurotransmitters, in a dose-dependent manner. Multivariate partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) identified metabolic changes associated with oxidative stress, disruption in hormone synthesis and reproduction, disturbance in osmoregulation and membrane stabilization, energy metabolism disorder, amino acid metabolism disorder, and neurotransmitter imbalance in PCP-exposed catfish. This study demonstrates the efficacy of metabolomics in elucidating the toxicity and underlying mechanisms of wood preservatives like PCP, providing valuable insights for risk assessment in toxicology research. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of the toxicological effects of PCP exposure on aquatic organisms and highlight the potential of histology, oxidative stress, and metabolomics in assessing environmental contaminants' risks.
40028067	Transgenic Innovation: Harnessing Cyclotides as Next Generation Pesticides.	Cyclotides are unique cyclic mini proteins derived from plants which are recognized for the distinctive cyclic cystine knot (CCK) structure and the cyclized backbone. To date, more than 760 sequences of cyclotides have been identified across five major families, making them the largest known group of cyclic peptides. These cyclic peptides derived from plants have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable structural stability and diverse bioactivities, including potent insecticidal properties, which offer a promising alternative to conventional pesticides that are often associated with environmental toxicity and resistance development in pests. Advances in transgenic technology have opened new avenues for the sustainable and targeted deployment of cyclotides in pest management. By incorporating cyclotide genes into crops, plants can gain enhanced self-defense mechanisms against insect pests, reducing reliance on chemical pesticides and mitigating ecological impact. This review explores the molecular features essential in cyclotides' insecticidal activity, the latest breakthroughs in transgenic strategies for cyclotide expression in crops, and the potential challenges and future prospects of this innovative approach. By highlighting the synergy between natural bioactive compounds and genetic engineering, this work underscores the potential of cyclotides as next-generation, eco-friendly biopesticides to address global agricultural challenges.
40027678	Effects of Pesticide Exposure on Neuroinflammation and Microglial Gene Expression: Relevance to Mechanisms of Alzheimer's Disease Risk.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. Previously, we reported serum levels of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the primary metabolite of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), were significantly higher in AD patients compared to age-matched controls and that DDT exposure worsened AD pathology in animal models.
40027642	Significant variations in tolerance to clothianidin and pirimiphos-methyl in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> and <i>Anopheles funestus</i> populations during a dramatic malaria resurgence despite sustained indoor residual spraying in Uganda.	A dramatic malaria resurgence occurred in areas of Uganda between 2020 and 2022 coincident with the switch to clothianidin-based formulations for indoor residual spraying. During the resurgence, <i>Anopheles funestus</i> numbers increased but when an alternative insecticide, pirimiphos methyl, was reintroduced in 2023, both malaria cases and <i>An. funestus</i> mosquito density fell. In this study, we investigated possible causes of the resurgence by assessing; 1) whether sufficient quantities of insecticide were sprayed; 2) the residual insecticide bioefficacy against wild mosquitoes and; 3) the insecticide susceptibility of vector populations using standard test tube assays and wall cone assays. In 2023, after adjusting for extraction efficiency, 70-80% of the houses had optimal residual concentrations of insecticides (clothianidin >0.3g/m<sup>2</sup>; pirimiphos methyl >0.5g/m<sup>2</sup>) with significant variations between sampling rounds and wall types. Mud walls had the lowest residual concentration of insecticides, and the lowest observed mortality in wall cone assays, compared to fired bricks with plaster/cement/paint. In the studies of residual bio efficacy, by World Health Organization (WHO) definitions, <i>An. funestus</i> showed resistance to clothianidin (<80% mortality) up to 11 months and susceptibility to pirimiphos methyl (>90% mortality) when exposed to wall surfaces up to 7 months post-spray. In WHO tube tests, variations were observed in susceptibility to clothianidin in <i>An. funestus</i> populations using dose- and time-response assays (80-98% mortality). In 2022, <i>An. gambiae</i> was largely susceptible to the clothianidin-based formulation Sumishield (85-90% mortality) although the levels dropped slightly in 2023 (60-85% mortality) mainly in mud and pole houses. In contrast, <i>An. gambiae</i> was mildly susceptible to the pirimiphos methyl-based formulation Actellic (~80% mortality) and time response assays showed <i>An. gambiae populations</i> had very low knockdown and mortality at lower exposure time compared to <i>An. funestus</i>. Regression models showed a positive association between residual insecticide concentration (RIC) and mortality in houses sprayed with Sumishield but not Actellic houses. Despite the possible variations observed in spray operations, the study revealed that <i>An</i>. <i>funestus</i> exhibited a higher tolerance to clothianidin-based formulations compared to <i>An. gambiae</i>, and this might have driven the malaria resurgence observed in Uganda. However, there are signals of <i>An. gambiae</i> resistance to pirimiphos-methyl which will require further investigation and monitoring.
40027412	The Genome of the Lima Bean Variety Baiyu Bean Highlights Its Evolutionary Characteristics.	The baiyu bean (<i>Phaseolus lunatus</i>), also known as the lima bean, is a plant belonging to the Fabaceae family, has a long and distinguished history of cultivation in China and is a highly regarded local variety of lima bean. In the current study, we present the reference genome of the baiyu bean variety, which has a scaffold N50 length of 47.545 Mb. A comparative genomic analysis was conducted using genomes of seven legume species, and the results demonstrated that 1564 and 1275 genes of baiyu bean exhibited expansion and contraction, respectively. Moreover, 543 genes were identified as exclusive to the baiyu bean. The analysis of adaptive evolution genes revealed the presence of 61 genes under adaptive evolution between <i>P. lunatus</i> and the common bean <i>P. vulgaris</i>. An examination of the branch model revealed the presence of five genes undergoing adaptive evolution in the <i>P. lunatus</i> branch. Additionally, the evolutionary selective pressure acting on other branches of legume plants was analyzed. A comprehensive analysis of structural variations (SVs) between the baiyu bean and G27455 genome was conducted, resulting in the identification of 5549 SVs. Among these, 333 genes were identified as high-impact SV genes. The acquisition of the genome sequence of this excellent variety will facilitate the exploration and utilization of its characteristics, providing a foundation for the genetic improvement of the lima bean.
40026091	Portable and Handheld Raman Instruments Open a Multitude of Applications.	Fundamental science can sometimes take a long time until it is useful for practical applications, as was the case for Raman spectroscopy. For a long time, it lacked powerful excitation sources and sensitive detectors. However as technology evolved, the number of exciting applications has boomed. Modern Raman spectroscopy has significant advantages, especially in sample preparation. Handheld Raman devices can be very compact and therefore be easily taken to the sample instead of bringing the sample to the lab. Non-destructive measurements obviously are important in gemmology and mineralogy, even in space. In the field of archaeology, pigments in precious ancient paintings, scrolls or books can be identified. This application is also used to identify fraud and falsification and in studies from a medical school they have reported that Raman spectroscopy can be applied to distinguish cancerous tissue from healthy tissue. Due to the mobility and ruggedness of the handheld hardware, Raman spectroscopy can be used for police, firefighters, and military applications for identification of explosives and illicit drugs or warfare substances. With SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy), Raman spectroscopy can even be used for trace analysis. The SERS effect enhances the sensitivity of the Raman signal by a factor of up to 107. This enables, for example, measuring pesticide residuals on fruit or vegetable surfaces for food safety. It can also be used to identify traces of drugs, e.g. in urine. However, one of the most common Raman-applications is the identity check or verification of incoming goods (RMID) in the pharma industries, directly in the warehouse. Users appreciate the ease of use and the ruggedness of the Raman hardware.
40026065	Electron Transfer-Driven Nanozymes Boost Biosensor Sensitivity via a Synergistic Signal Amplification Strategy.	The conventional gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with insufficient brightness face substantial challenges in developing a sensitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA). Herein, multibranched manganese-gold (Mn-Au) nanoparticles (MnAuNPs) with a Au core-Mn shell nanostructure were synthesized by a one-pot method. The Mn shell of valence-rich and Au core of high electron transfer efficiency endowed MnAuNPs with oxidase-like activity, which oxidized 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) only by electron transfer. Ox-TMB, which was the oxidation product of TMB, is an excellent photothermal agent. Furthermore, the synergistic photothermal effect of ox-TMB and MnAuNPs significantly enhanced the photothermal conversion efficiency. The synergistic photothermal effect of multibranched MnAuNPs and ox-TMB has enabled highly sensitive quantitative detection. The LFIA based on MnAuNPs (cascade LFIA) has achieved sensitive detection of <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7. The entire detection process was completed in 25 min. The limit of detection of cascade LFIA was 239 CFU mL<sup>-1</sup>, which was 37.21-fold lower than that of AuNPs-LFIA (8892 CFU mL<sup>-1</sup>). The recoveries of cascade LFIA were 82.63-111.67%, with coefficients of variation of 4.28-14.19%. Overall, this work suggests the potential of MnAuNPs and ox-TMB in the development of sensitive LFIA and broadens the biosensing strategies for point-of-care testing.
40025757	Current Used Pesticides in Air and Soil in Eastern China: Occurrence, Spatial-Seasonal Distribution, and Air-Soil Exchange.	Current used pesticides (CUPs) are extensively used as alternatives for traditional pesticides in the world. In order to investigate the pollution characteristics of CUPs in a large-scale multimedium environment, a comprehensive and comparative study was conducted on occurrence, spatial-seasonal distribution, and air-soil exchange of CUPs across 30° latitude in Eastern China. A total of 72 target CUPs were detected, and 43 CUPs had a detection frequency over 30% in both air and soil samples. Herbicides, fungicides, and organophosphorus insecticides predominantly exhibited volatilization from soil to air, while pyrethroids exhibited deposition from air to soil. In the high-latitude Northeastern China, the air-soil exchange net flux of CUPs was the lowest due to the lower temperature, especially in winter. Along with decreasing latitude and increasing temperature, the air-soil exchange flux increased, which was significantly influenced by cultivation practices and the usage frequency of CUPs. Therefore, the grasshopper effect driven by temperature difference caused further migration and deposition of CUPs toward higher latitude regions. Moreover, the emission fluxes of CUPs to soil exhibited significant variations closely linked to local climatic conditions and types of crops. In summary, this study obtained valuable baseline information for the pollution characteristics and air-soil exchange of CUPs on a large scale, which also provided a better understanding of the environmental fate of CUPs from the migration perspective.
40025559	Changing Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence in two villages of northeastern Tanzania between 2003 and 2021 in relation to vectors, interventions and climatic factors.	Malaria, which affects over half of the world's population, is controlled through clinical interventions and vector control strategies. However, these efforts are threatened by resistance to anti-malarial drugs and insecticides, as well as affected by environmental, ecological, and climatic changes. This study examined changes in malaria prevalence and related factors based on data from 18 cross-sectional surveys conducted in two villages in northeastern Tanzania.
40025519	Factors affecting community participation in drone-based larviciding using Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) for bio-control of malaria vectors in Rwanda.	Malaria remains a significant health issue in Rwanda. Primary malaria prevention methods include insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying as core interventions. Mosquito repellents, larval source management (LSM), and housing improvement are recommended as supplemental vector control methods. A 2020-2021 study in rice field habitats of peri-urban of Kigali City successfully evaluated the entomological and epidemiological impacts of drone-based larviciding using Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti).
40025493	Access and usage of malaria control measures by women of reproductive age in Mopeia Mozambique.	Malaria presents a disproportionate threat to pregnant women, making access to malaria prevention tools crucial for controlling the disease in this vulnerable population.
40025483	The acaricidal and repellent activity of the essential and nano essential oil of Thymus vulgaris against the larval and engorged adult stages of the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Acari: Ixodidae).	The brown dog tick is globally distributed and harms the host in terms of blood feeding and pathogen transfer. Chemicals are traditionally used for the control, but herbal plants have been investigated mainly due to their natural components with killing and repellant effects. Previously, the role of thymol has been described for the biocontrol of ticks at different stages. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the effects of a thymol-rich herbal plant, Thymus vulgaris L., and its major constituents on Rhipicephalus sanguineus.
40025436	Molecular characterization of resistance and biofilm genes of ESKAPE pathogens isolated from clinical samples: examination of the effect of boric acid on biofilm ability by cell culture method.	Biofilm formation ranks first among the resistance and virulence factors crucial in forming ESKAPE pathogens. Once biofilm is formed, treating the infection with existing drugs is often futile. Therefore, in this study, resistant ESKAPE pathogens were isolated from intensive care units and sent to Atatürk University Yakutiye Research Hospital Microbiology Laboratory. This study investigated the biofilm formation and molecular characterization of resistant ESKAPE pathogens isolated from intensive care units. The bacteria's biofilm formation abilities, genes responsible for biofilm formation, and resistance characteristics were identified. The effect of boric acid (BA) on resistance and bacterial genes was evaluated by a bacterial infection cell culture model. The highest biofilm formation was observed in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterococcus spp. isolates showed the vanA gene in 14.6% and the vanC gene in 61% of the samples. Among Staphylococcus spp. isolates, 48.3% were MSSA, 34.5% were MRCNS, and 17.2% were MRSA. The KPC gene was detected in 50%, the OXA-48 gene in 40%, and the NDM gene in 15% of the isolates. In P. aeruginosa, the LasI and LasR quorum sensing system genes were found in 38.5% and 30.8% of the isolates, respectively. In E. coli isolates, OXA-48 was present in 35%, KPC in 31.7%, and TEM in 12.5%. BA demonstrated significant activity against ESKAPE pathogens. The combined antimicrobial activity of boron compounds showed a decrease in the expression level of the resistance gene. It will be promising for preventing hospital-associated infections.
40025385	Evaluation of Bacillus sp. strain isolated from pesticide influenced rhizospheric soil for dimethoate degrading potential.	Pesticides play a major role in the current scenario of Indian agriculture. Agriculture is a backbone of the country's economy contributing to 54% of employment. Being a vastly populated country, food aid dependency rate is very high. To meet the requirements of such a huge supply, high crop yields are necessary to sustain the food security. Thus, an abundance use of pesticides is quite common, ranking among the top producers of pesticide in the world. Organophosphates (OPP) being one of the major pesticides used in India. Known for causing acute toxicity, organophosphate pesticides are needed to be used controllably, and residues released into the environment should be treated to render them harmless. Biological degradation is one of the most effective ways to achieve that. However, exploring potential candidate for the purpose is still not sufficient compared to the necessity to alleviate organophosphates from the environment. This study examines the microbial degradation of dimethoate, an organophosphate pesticide, using Bacillus paramycoides. These bacteria were isolated from the rhizospheric soil of sugarcane fields in Sevur, Tamil Nadu, India, which has been exposed to dimethoate for over 10 years. The strain has been extensively studied to check its prospect for environmental stress, pesticide tolerance, and degradation efficiency. Degradation of dimethoate was detected by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The isolate was found to degrade dimethoate by 97.6% in 5 days with a tolerance of 1000ppm for the targeted pesticide. Emphasis have also been placed on detecting the secondary metabolites produced by the isolate using gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry(GC-MS) analysis, in which, a compound Phosphorothioic O, O,S-acid, a probable by-product of dimethoate degradation was identified. Significant other biologically important metabolites obtained from B.paramycoides, have also been reported in this study, which are known to have different anticancerous and antibacterial properties.
40025243	Secondary prevention with antiplatelet medications in patients with antiphospholipid antibody-related stroke.	Clinical guidelines recommend warfarin for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and ischemic stroke; however, robust evidence is lacking. We investigated the clinical benefits of different categories of antithrombotic medications in ischemic stroke patients positive for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) in real-world practice. We reviewed data from patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack who tested positive for aPLs. Based on their secondary preventive antithrombotic medications, patients were classified into antiplatelet and anticoagulant categories, and further into warfarin, single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), and direct oral anticoagulant groups. The outcome of interest was a composite of recurrent thrombosis and major bleeding events. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards model was used. Among 167 eligible patients, 28 experienced composite outcome events over 601.1 person-years. SAPT and DAPT demonstrated clinical benefits over warfarin (SAPT vs. warfarin, adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence intervals], 0.24 [0.07-0.83]; DAPT vs. warfarin, 0.25 [0.08-0.81]). Notably, DAPT was advantageous regarding major bleeding (DAPT vs. warfarin, 0.10 [0.02-0.47]), while the risk of recurrent thrombotic events was comparable between the antiplatelet and warfarin groups. Antiplatelet therapy may be a safe and effective alternative to warfarin for secondary prevention of aPL- and APS-related stroke. Further prospective validation is required.
40025204	Residential environment, human behavior and socio-economic status in transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis in central Iran.	Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector-borne disease occurred through the bite of sandflies. Due to impact of environmental factors on the disease, this study aimed to assess the association between socio-economic status (SES), domestic, peri-domestic, and human behavior factors and the transmission of CL in Isfahan province in central Iran. This case-control study was conducted from March 2021 till March 2022 on 322 participants. Cases and controls were selected among CL patients and people with no history of leishmaniasis respectively by cluster random sampling method in a ratio of 1:1. A semi-structured questionnaire was completed for each patient and control. Multiple logistic regression models and odds ratio (OR) estimator were used to assess the relationships. In final model after adjusting for potential confounders the variables "moderate social and economic status", "individuals who rest outside at night in summer", "the presence of animals near the residence" and also the variables related to distance of homes to gathering places of insects remained significant. Adults and individuals who use preventive measures such as insecticides, insect repellent pen and sleeping the mosquito net significantly decrease the risk of disease. Our findings showed that human behavior and peri-domestic factors have most effects on transmission of leishmaniasis.
40025163	Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel associated with permethrin resistance in Rhipicephalus linnaei populations in Thailand.	Insecticide resistance is a serious threat to vector control programs worldwide. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the development of resistance in vector populations. Rhipicephalus linnaei (Audouin, 1826) is a cosmopolitan tick and a vector of medically important pathogens. We conducted a comprehensive investigation of permethrin resistance in larvae of Rh. linnaei populations across Thailand by comparing phenotypic resistance with tick genotypes, focusing on mutations in Domain II and III of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene. Results showed that larvae obtained from engorged female tick populations in Thailand have developed resistance to permethrin, with levels varying by location. Resistance ratios ranged from 1 to 56 when compared to the least susceptible local population. Genotyping identified mutations at positions 190 (c.190C > A and c.190C > G) and 2134 (c.2134T > C) in Domain II and Domain III, respectively, which are correlated with phenotypic resistance. We identified new alleles c.190CG and c.190AG in highly resistant populations from Phasichareon, Bangkok, and Chonburi provinces. This study provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, of permethrin resistance in Rh. linnaei ticks in Thailand. Elevated levels of permethrin resistance in Rh. linnaei populations across Thailand indicate that veterinarians and farmers should consider tick control products with alternative modes of action.
40025135	Imbalance of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte subsets following atrazine treatment.	While being banned in the European Union, the herbicide atrazine (ATR) is still one of the most used herbicides in the world. ATR is classified as an endocrine disruptor, but the immunotoxic effects of ATR may also be due to its direct impact on immune cells. To study the effects of ATR on human T cells, we activated T cells present in PBMCs of 8 healthy donors in the presence of ATR (0.1-100 μM). After 4 days of culture, T cells were stained to evaluate cell growth and phenotype by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that ATR treatment exerts an antiproliferative activity on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and decreases their activation, including the percentage of cytokine-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Among these, the percentage of interferon (IFN)-γ- and interleukin (IL)-22-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells decreased within total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, IL-4-, IL-10- and IL-17-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells decreased within cytokine-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Consequently, ATR caused a dose-related decrease in Th1/Th2 ratio. Many of the effects of ATR treatment were quantitatively different in males and females, with more pronounced effects observed in females. tSNE analysis demonstrated that ATR strongly inhibited the differentiation of two subsets of IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>IL-4<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from each of the healthy donors tested and promoted greater differentiation of the CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset from seven out of the eight healthy donors tested. In conclusion, the study suggests that ATR skews CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation towards Th2, a phenotype that may promote reduced immunosurveillance and increased risk of cancer, as well as Th2-related diseases such as asthma, thereby presenting an environmental and occupation-related risk to human health.
40024951	Neuroprotective capacity of Celastrus paniculatus on rotenone-induced parkinsonism in zebrafish model.	Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, affects millions globally, with age, genetics, and environmental conditions increasing risk. Global burden could reach 12 million by 2050. To observe the effect of Celastrus paniculatus in rotenone-induced Parkinsonism in zebrafish model.
40024515	Using new approach methodologies for the identification of a sensitizing co-formulant in a plant protection product.	According to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, plant protection products (PPPs) can be classified for skin sensitisation by either considering the full formulation or the individual components. For a fraction of PPPs, an application of both assessment strategies results in discrepant classification results. We here aimed to resolve this discrepancy for PPP 1, an exemplary product, which was classified as sensitizing by a positive local lymph node assay but scored negative by the component-based method. We collected further data, as suggested by the regulation, based on a combination of new approach methodologies (NAMs) covering several key events (KEs) in the adverse outcome pathway model for skin sensitisation. Precisely, we employed quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis (KE 1), the human cell line activation test (h-CLAT) complemented by Interleukin-8 release measurements (KE 3) and a novel short-term T cell test that is based on the induced expression of activation markers (KE 4). We tested the complete product, individual co-formulants (CFs) or single substances. PPP 1 tested positive in all in vitro assays. QSAR analysis revealed two CFs containing sensitizing chemicals. Only CF 1 was tested positive in the h-CLAT at a minimal induction threshold of 1.5 mg/mL, being less potent than PPP 1. In the T cell assay, both PPP 1 and CF 1 were tested positive at around 0.1 mg/mL. In conclusion, our results propose a novel integrated NAM-based strategy that should be explored further for skin sensitisation hazard identification of complex mixtures, such as PPPs.
40024501	A birth cohort observational study to assess the association of prenatal biomarkers of organophosphates with visual attention, recognition memory and information processing among Thai infants.	Organophosphates (OPs) are neurotoxicants used to control pests on crops (e.g., rice). Thai women farmworkers (∼23%) may be exposed during childbearing years. Previous literature documents adverse neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal exposure to pesticides although findings are inconsistent.
40024432	Hydrogen sulfide mechanism of action in plants; from interaction with regulatory molecules to persulfidation of proteins.	Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), previously known as a toxic gas, is currently considered one of the most important gaseous transmitters in plants. This novel signaling molecule has been determined to play notable roles in plant growth, development, and maturation. In addition, pharmacological and genetic evidence indicated that this regulatory molecule effectively ameliorates various plant stress conditions. H<sub>2</sub>S is involved in these processes by changing gene expression, enzyme activities, and metabolite concentrations. During its regulatory function, H<sub>2</sub>S interacts with other signaling pathways such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), nitric oxide (NO), Ca<sup>2+</sup>, carbon monoxide (CO), phosphatidic acid (PA), phytohormones, etc. The H<sub>2</sub>S mechanism of action may depend on the persulfidation post-translational modification (PTM), which attacks the cysteine (Cys) residues on the target proteins and changes their structure and activities. This review summarized H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis pathways, its role in sulfide state, and its donors in plant biology. We also discuss recent progress in the research on the interactions of H<sub>2</sub>S with other signaling molecules, as well as the role of persulfidation in modulating various plant reactions.
40024416	Biochemical and toxicological characteristics of an acid phosphatase from red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).	Red palm weevil (RPW) Rhynchophorus ferrugineus is destructive pests of almost all kind of palms. Acid phosphatase (AcP) distributed in different major tissues and during larval development, the whole gut and the 11th instar larvae displayed the highest activity. Two isoenzymes were detected in the late stages. The purified predominant AcP isoenzyme has molecular weight 30 kDa, optimum activity at pH 5.0 and temperature 40 °C. The enzyme hydrolyzed various phosphoric esters has a Km value 3.33 and 5.0 mM for p-NPP and α-NP as substrates, respectively. It differentially affected by metal cations, different compounds and inhibitors. Ammonium molybdate completely inhibited the enzyme at 50 μM. Tartaric acid, oxalic acid and L-phenyl alanine competitively inhibited the enzyme with Ki values ranged from 0.044 to 0.34 mM. The enzyme differentially inhibited by different botanical extracts, Cinnamomum camphora completely inhibited the enzyme at 65 mg/ml, noncompetitively inhibited by gallic acid with Ki 2.8 mM. It has different susceptibility towards different insecticides, competitively, non- competitively and mixed competitively inhibited with Ki ranged from 0.16 to 1.0 mM. Knowledge the resistance status of RPW is important for researchers to guide the farming community in combating problems and paving the way for developing the management strategies.
40024079	Biophysical and structural insights into Azamethiphos-DNA interactions.	Azamethiphos (AZA), an organophosphate pesticide, is well-known for its cholinesterase inhibition and associated toxic risks to non-target organisms. Its high-water solubility facilitates environmental contamination and persistence, increasing the risk of human exposure through bioaccumulation in agricultural products. This study investigates AZA's DNA-binding potential and underlying interaction mechanisms. Using in silico techniques, we analyzed AZA's interactions with DNA, revealing that hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in stabilizing the AZA-DNA complex. The study found that AZA preferentially binds to AT-rich regions of Ct-DNA, suggesting it acts as a groove binder by fitting into the grooves of the DNA double helix Additionally, fluorescence spectroscopy studies of AZA with DNA were conducted at three temperatures (288 K, 298 K, and 308 K). These experiments demonstrated that AZA binds to Ct-DNA with a moderate binding affinity (3.868, 2.238 and 0.0061 x 10<sup>4</sup> LM<sup>-1</sup> at 288, 298 and 308 K respectively). Thermodynamic analysis confirmed the binding process is spontaneous (ΔG < 0), enthalpy driven (ΔH < 0, ΔS < 0) and facilitated by the presence of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals. These findings provide molecular-level insights into AZA's interactions with Ct-DNA, emphasizing its potential effects on genetic material. Understanding these interactions is crucial for assessing AZA's biological risks.
40024046	Pesticide contamination detected across five wildlife refuges in the Sacramento Valley of California.	An important goal for the applied ecological sciences is to understand the extent to which the biodiversity on conserved or managed lands is exposed to anthropogenic stressors. Among the various categories of conserved lands in the United States, the National Wildlife Refuge System is focused on the protection and management of native wildlife and plant populations. Refuge lands can be associated with wetlands and, especially in California, tend to be near areas of intense human use, including agriculture. The proximity of refuges to cultivated lands results in potential exposure to pesticide drift, which increases the possibility of non-target effects on plants and wildlife. We used a passive sampler approach to quantify aerial pesticide deposition during 28 days in spring of 2023, across five refuges in the Sacramento Valley of California. Pesticides were detected across all refuges and plots within the study area, with 36 individual compounds identified, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, from 176 silicone bands from 49 plots. Distance to agriculture was not an important predictor in our models for most indices of contamination. However, our models revealed that the nearest crop type was an important mediator of the importance of distance to agriculture, as fungicide contamination decreased with distance to agriculture only when orchards were the nearest crop type. The overall lack of distance effects suggests that the interior of refuges in the study area do not necessarily provide more protection from pesticides than refuge edges, although larger refuges could offer more protection. We currently lack information on how the level of contamination found herein is biologically relevant to wildlife, and ongoing monitoring efforts have found productive communities of insects in the study area. The results of this study provide a foundation for future investigations on refuges to analyze impacts of specific pesticide compounds on plants and wildlife.
40023997	Urinary glyphosate, selenium status, and their impact on mortality: Evidence from NHANES 2013-2018.	Glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), extensively used worldwide, have been associated with various health concerns, including an elevated risk of mortality. Experimental studies suggest that these herbicides may disrupt selenium homeostasis by hindering its uptake or promoting oxidative stress. However, the interplay between glyphosate exposure and selenium status remains poorly understood in epidemiological studies, particularly regarding selenium's role in modulating the mortality risk associated with glyphosate exposure in nationally representative populations.
40023878	Worst case scenario for chronic mixed ecotoxicity, assessment of ecological and human health risks from contaminants in an important economic harbor connected to the Mediterranean Sea, Egypt.	This study is a preliminary assessment of the worst-case scenario of chronic cumulative toxicity of pollutants to marine life in Abu-Qir Bay, Egypt. In addition, human health risks from ingestion, ingestion during swimming, and dermal contact with contaminants were evaluated for children, females and males. Five heavy metals, thirteen polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), twenty pesticides (OCPs) and five polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in the seawater column and sediments. The average cumulative pollution indices, including the Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI: 3.44 ± 0.24) and the Heavy Metal Evaluation Index (HEI: 0.46 ± 0.04), reflected low impacts of heavy metal pollution in seawater, while the Mean Effect Range Medium Quotient (mERMQ: 0.123 ± 0.024) demonstrated low-moderate potential adverse biological effects in sediments. Among PAHs, Benzo[a]pyrene was the most abundant in the seawater (56.0 ng/L). Individual chronic RQ<sub>Species(MEC/PNEC)</sub> (>1) values revealed high ecotoxicological sensitivity of invertebrates to Hg, Pb, and PAHs (Pyrene and Anthracene), fish to Pb, Cr, Hg, Cd, and PAHs (Benzo[k]fluoranthene, Fluoranthene, and Benzo[a]pyrene), and algae to Benzo[a]pyrene in sediments. The worst-case scenario of chronic ecotoxicity of a mixture of pollutants was evaluated by using Risk Quotients based on Predicted no Effect Concentration (RQ<sub>Mixture (MEC/PNEC)</sub>), Sum of Toxic Units (RQ<sub>Mixture(STU)</sub>), Relative Contribution (mixture RC) and %STU to algae, invertebrates and fish along the seawater and sediments in the study area. RQ<sub>Mixture (MEC/PNEC)</sub> and (mixture RC) values reflected that invertebrates were the most sensitive species to the pollutant mixture in seawater, while algae were the most sensitive species in sediments. In general, non-cancer and carcinogenic health risks to humans from exposure to a mixture of pollutants have not been shown to have any harmful effects, with the exception of chromium in seawater for children. Hazard Ratio (HR) values for children, females and males also demonstrated the potential carcinogenic effects of OCPs in seawater.
40023614	Iron and copper codoped carbon nanodots as oxidase mimics and fluorescent probes for detection of phenol and dimethoate.	Fluorescent nanozymes represent a class of dual-functional nanomaterials that exhibit inherent enzyme-like catalytic properties alongside fluorescent emission, making them suitable for multiple detection applications. However, the number of publications on this subject is limited, primarily due to potential interference between the two processes. In this study, oxidase-like fluorescent iron and copper codoped carbon dots (Fe,Cu-CDs) were synthesized via a one-pot pyrolysis reaction. The results demonstrated that the carbon dots could catalyze the oxidative coupling reaction between phenol and 4-aminoantipyrine, while their fluorescence emission was enhanced upon coordination with thiol compounds. By integrating the dimethoate-mediated, acetylcholinesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of thiocholine, a dual-detection platform was developed for the colorimetric detection of phenol and the fluorometric detection of dimethoate, achieving detection limits of 0.103 μM and 1.94 × 10<sup>-5</sup> µg/mL, respectively. This method was subsequently applied to detect these two pollutants in real water and vegetable samples, and the results demonstrated favorable recovery rates and good reproducibility. This work not only presents a novel strategy for the synthesis and application of dual-functional carbon dots in pollutant analysis but also offers new insights into the design of dual-functional carbon dots for efficient and cost-effective multidetection.
40023526	Resistance evolution and local adaptation of Venturia inaequalis to old and new generation SDHI fungicides.	The use of succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides is widespread in controlling apple scab disease caused by Venturia inaequalis. However, resistance in populations develops and new SDHIs are generated commercially, thus evaluating this arms-race in local populations is important for appropriate disease management. In this study, in vitro mycelial growth effects of five commercial fungicides, including old and new generation SDHIs on a large V. inaequalis population in Türkiye were investigated. Overall, the entire population was resistant to Boscalid (Cantus®), and the most effective fungicides tested were Isopyrazam (REFLECT®) and Pydiflumetofen (Candidate fungicide, Miravis®). Although the results show the effectiveness of new generation SDHIs, remarkable differences in pathogen resistance responses were detected at local level. There were also differences in colony growth rates among isolates, but this was not associated with fungicide response traits. Furthermore, the intraspecies genetic diversities obtained from the sequence data of the four selected gene regions were depicted with the Neigbour_Joining (NJ) trees. There appeared to be no relationship between NJ-based branching and fungicide response phenotypes. As a result of mating type determinationof the isolates with newly designed primers, 1:1 ratio indicated possible recombination in almost all local groups, with one exception. Additionally, detection of both mating type genes in some isolates was an interesting finding about the reproductive structure of the pathogen. This study, which is the first comprehensive study of V. inaequalis in Türkiye, presents new findings about the pathogen from different perspectives.
40023423	Structural characterization, antioxidant activity, and mechanism of polysaccharides isolated from Dictyophora rubrovalvata stipet.	Dictyophora rubrovalvata is a valuable edible fungus. Its stipe, is rich in polysaccharides, possesses potential biological activity and medicinal value. In this study, we isolated a new polysaccharide, DRP-L, from the stipe of D. rubrovalvata, characterized its structure, and used PC12 to examine its antioxidant effect and mechanism. The results of structural analysis showed that the molecular weight of DRP-L was approximately 2.14 × 10<sup>3</sup> kDa. The monosaccharide composition included D-galactose, D-mannose, and d-glucose with a relative molar ratio of 0.41:1:0.37. In the activity study, in vitro antioxidant experiments demonstrated that DRP-L has commendable antioxidant activity. Simultaneously, DRP-L can protect PC12 cells from oxidative damage by reducing the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in a dose-dependent manner, with the best effect at a concentration of 1.6 mg/mL. Western blotting results indicated that DRP-L could shield PC12 cells from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage by managing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, suppressing the expression of Caspase-3 and BAX, and boosting Bcl-2 expression and Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, with its unique structure and remarkable antioxidant activity, DRP-L offers new insights and directions for developing antioxidants based on natural products.
40023338	Cross-species comparisons of plasma binding and considerations for data evaluation.	The US Environmental Protection Agency is increasingly employing new approach methods (NAMs), including in vitro plasma binding and hepatocyte clearance experiments to collect chemical-species specific data. This paper presents data from plasma binding experiments using rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) devices and plasma from humans, rats, and rainbow trout with a 4-h incubation time. A total of 54 chemicals, utilizing two concentrations, were tested across the three species resulting in 238 chemical-species specific datasets. Mass balance controls for chemical plasma stability and dialysis system recovery were used to evaluate the datasets and almost 40 % of the datasets (92/238 datasets) produced quantitative measurements. Cross-species comparisons and evaluations of the impact of physicochemical properties on chemical-assay performance were also evaluated. Comparisons of human-rat plasma binding revealed rat plasma generally demonstrated higher f<sub>up</sub> values for chemicals than human. While f<sub>up</sub> values in trout plasma were frequently lower than rat or human plasma. A comparison with literature data was performed and correlations between plasma binding, expressed as fraction unbound in plasma (f<sub>up</sub>), and log K<sub>ow</sub> across all three species indicate that the strongest relationship occurs at log K<sub>ow</sub> values between 1.5 and 4. The obtained datasets exhibited a wide range of behaviors, emphasizing the need for a robust approach to data quality assessment. The broader analysis of f<sub>up</sub> values indicates that chemicals with log K<sub>ow</sub> > 4.5 will be highly bound (f<sub>up</sub> ≤ 0.0001), difficult to measure, and have low reproducibility across laboratories, suggesting that use of different methods may be needed across different physicochemical properties.
40023241	Exploring the epigenetic impacts of atrazine in zebrafish: Unveiling mechanisms of neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and implications for human health.	Atrazine (ATZ), a widely utilized herbicide, is notable for its long environmental half-life and high solubility, raising significant concerns regarding its ecological and health impacts. While debates continue over its role as an endocrine disruptor, increasing attention has been directed toward its potential epigenetic effects. Utilizing the zebrafish model, a vertebrate with considerable genetic similarity to humans, provides valuable insights into how ATZ exposure may translate into human health risks. This review systematically examines the differential DNA methylation induced by ATZ's non-competitive inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, miRNA dysregulation resulting from mutations in miRNA processing enzymes, and the complex epigenetic interactions affecting histone modifications. Additionally, potential epigenetic biomarkers for ATZ exposure are proposed, which could advance targeted treatment strategies and improve health risk assessments. This synthesis of current understanding identifies knowledge gaps and guides future research towards a more comprehensive understanding of ATZ's epigenetic mechanisms.
40022983	Occurrence and fate of glyphosate and AMPA in wastewater treatment plants in Australia.	Glyphosate is the most used herbicide globally, but little is known of its prevalence in the Australian environment or its behaviour during wastewater treatment. This study examined the concentration of glyphosate and its primary biodegradation product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), in influent and effluent from 22 Australian wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) to inform exposure risks. Glyphosate was detected in all 22 WWTP influent samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.37 to 370 μg/L (mean: 22 ± 76 μg/L). In treated effluent, glyphosate was found in 82 % of samples with concentrations ranging from <LOQ (0.2 μg/L) to 11 μg/L (mean: 2.1 ± 3.1 μg/L). AMPA was detected in the influent of four of the 22 WWTP, with concentrations ranging from <LOQ to 32 μg/L (mean: 1.4 ± 5.2 μg/L). AMPA was detected in the effluent samples at eleven sites, with concentrations ranging from <LOQ to 19 μg/L. Glyphosate removal efficiency varied by treatment process. Plants with tertiary treatment (n = 10) removed on average 76 % of the glyphosate, while primary treatment sites (n = 4) removed the lowest (mean: -102 %; higher in the effluent). One tertiary treatment site had glyphosate concentrations 160 % higher in the treated effluent, suggesting additional sources post treatment. The mean population weighted mass load of glyphosate in treated effluent was 572 ± 856 mg per day per 1000 inhabitants, with an estimated 5000 kg/year of glyphosate reaching the Australian aquatic environment. A temporal study at two influent sites identified increasing glyphosate use over the past decade. Despite the widespread presence of glyphosate in effluent, all concentrations were all below the current Australian freshwater species protection guideline of 180 μg/L.
40022979	Characterizing pyrethroid and fipronil concentrations in biosolids.	Pesticides are prevalent in wastewater, yet few studies have measured pesticides in biosolids and aqueous media from samples collected concurrently. Seventeen California wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were sampled in May 2020. Biosolids samples were analyzed for 27 analytes, and paired aqueous samples (influent and effluent) were analyzed for 23 analytes. Analytes included fipronil and its transformation products (fiproles), pyrethroids, novaluron, and several other pesticides with down-the-drain transport potential. Of the 27 compounds analyzed in biosolids samples, 16 were detected in at least one sample, and 10 had a detection frequency (DF) of at least 25 %. Fipronil sulfone, fipronil sulfide, and fipronil were the most frequently detected fiproles (DF = 100 %, 94 %, and 67 %, respectively); permethrin was the most frequently detected pyrethroid (DF = 100 %), followed by bifenthrin (DF = 94 %), cyhalothrin (DF = 89 %), and etofenprox (DF = 78 %). To elucidate fipronil transformation pathways within the treatment system, data from the three sample types were compared; findings were generally consistent with transformation pathways reported previously (e.g., some fiproles were rarely detected in influent or biosolids, but frequently detected in effluent, indicating their formation during the treatment process). No correlations were found between WWTP characteristics and pesticide concentrations in biosolids. The fraction of organic carbon (f<sub>OC</sub>) of each biosolids sample was measured, and a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between f<sub>OC</sub> and some fiproles, but not fipronil; possible explanations are discussed. Additional analysis for two major agricultural pesticides (bifenthrin and permethrin) indicated that estimated mass loads of these pesticides in biosolids applied to land as a soil amendment are minimal (approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower) compared to inputs from agricultural applications. This study provides insight on the magnitude of pesticides entering the environment via land-applied biosolids; existing regulations surrounding agricultural pesticide applications are expected to also be protective of the relatively low inputs from biosolids.
40022969	Climatic vulnerability and adaptation strategies for vegetable production in the Northern Himalayan region.	Vegetable production in the low and mid hills is highly vulnerable to climatic vulnerability. The study evaluated the Agricultural Climatic Vulnerability Index (ACVI) for 51 blocks in the regions using the IPCC AR4 conceptual framework. The developmental blocks were categorized into three groups (Low, Moderate and Highly Vulnerable) to collect the primary data. A multistage stratified random sampling technique was employed, using a pre-tested questionnaire. The ACVI findings reveal that the Balh Valley is the most climate-vulnerable block, while Paonta Sahib is the least. Vulnerability is primarily driven by the temperature variations in the Kharif and Rabi seasons of exposure dimension. The farm income analysis shows a decline in crop feasibility from low to high-vulnerability groups. Maximum temperature significantly reduced net crop returns, except in the case of cauliflower. Rainfall negatively impacted the profitability of crops such as tomatoes, capsicum and peas. However, an increase in the minimum temperature significantly boosted vegetable crop profitability in vulnerable groups. A balanced use of fertilizer and pesticide application, crop diversification and increased irrigation coverage significantly mitigated climate change impacts across all vulnerability groups and improved crop profitability. Among the crops studied, tomato exhibited the highest carbon sequestration potential, followed by capsicum, pea, French beans and cauliflower. A significant variation was observed in the carbon sequestration level across vulnerability groups. Farmers in these regions have adopted various adaptation strategies, including crop diversification (76.11%), nutrient management (71.11 %), varietal changes (65.56 %), and water conservation (65.56 %). To enhance resilience, the study emphasizes the importance of improved technical knowledge, capacity building, adoption of better agronomic practices, increased financial support, and comprehensive stakeholder consultation within the agricultural and allied sectors.
40022934	Occurrence, spatial-seasonal variation and air-soil exchange of traditional and novel organochlorine pesticides across 30° latitude in Eastern China: Old tales and new realities.	While traditional organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been phased out under international regulations, novel OCPs are increasingly used as substitutes, however, their environmental behavior was not well clarified. Here, the first comprehensive study on the occurrence, seasonal-spatial variation, and air-soil exchange of both traditional and novel OCPs across a 30° latitudinal gradient (22°N to 52°N) in Eastern China were conducted. Air concentrations of ΣOCPs peaked during summer months, whereas soil concentrations were elevated in winter. Notably, novel OCPs exhibited pronounced spatial-seasonal variations due to the influence of ongoing application practices. Distinct source-sink relationships were observed between traditional and novel OCPs: soils acted as a "secondary source" for traditional OCPs year-round, while for novel OCPs, soils changed from a "secondary source" in summer to a "sink" in winter. Air-soil exchange net fluxes demonstrated significant seasonal variations, with enhancement at higher temperatures and lower latitudes. Emission fluxes to soil for traditional OCPs were concentrated in central and northeastern regions influenced by historical use and distillation effect. In contrast, novel OCPs showed higher emission fluxes in central and southeastern regions, correlating with current usage patterns. In summary, this study provided baseline information on the pollution characteristics and environmental behaviors of both traditional and novel OCPs, which would help us for better understanding their migration and fate in China, even on the global scale.
40022517	Predictors of bed bug-related stress in people who have experienced a recent infestation. Results from a cross-sectional survey in the city of Lyon, France.	The number of bed bug infestations has risen dramatically in the past decades. Infestations are responsible for mental health issues such as lower quality of life, insomnia and symptoms that may resemble those of post-traumatic stress disorders. Here, we sought to investigate whether bed bug-related stress may be predicted by a range of sociodemographic, clinical and infestation-related characteristics. We collected data using a paper and online survey of 305 adults who had experienced a bed bug infestation.
40022516	Deep learning-based weed detection for precision herbicide application in turf.	Precision weed mapping in turf according to its susceptibility to selective herbicides allows the smart sprayer to spot-spray the most pertinent herbicides onto the susceptible weeds. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing herbicide susceptibility-based weed mapping using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to facilitate targeted and efficient herbicide applications. Additionally, applying path-planning algorithms to weed mapping data to guide the spraying nozzle ensures minimal travel paths for herbicide application.
40022515	Why is it so clean under the apple trees: discovery of novel phloretin derivatives as potential herbicidal agents.	Weeds are a serious problem in worldwide agricultural production. Natural products are a notable source for discovering new lead compounds. Phloretin is a dihydrochalcone compound which was discovered in 1835 and named after its concentrated content in roots, stems or bark of fruits. Within apple orchards, there are typically fewer weeds on the areas covered with fallen leaves compared to areas without fallen leaves. This interesting phenomenon suggested that phloretin may have potential herbicidal activity. Through the principle of bioisosterism and combination of active structural moieties, structures of amide, chalcone and flavanone were integrated with phloretin, with the objective to obtain novel phloretin derivatives to test as herbicides.
40022514	Assembly of thioether analogs from 2-mercaptobenzoxazole-fused honokiol and heterocyclic scaffolds and evaluation of their agrochemical potential.	Persistent and excessive application of conventional synthetic pesticides has triggered a series of environmental and agricultural product safety risks in recent decades. Natural products are considered to provide considerable sources for the innovation of novel ecofriendly agrochemicals with high efficacy.
40022367	The diversity and disparity of mineral elements in global kiwifruits.	Mineral elements in fruits are essential for various physiological functions and offer significant health benefits. While kiwifruit is valued for its vitamin C and nutritional content, the role of its mineral composition and distribution in fruit safety and disease remains unclear. This study analyzed the mineral composition of kiwifruits from 12 cultivars across 4 countries, identifying 20 mineral elements. Notably, potassium and magnesium concentrations were significantly higher compared to those in most commonly consumed fruits. The mineral profiles varied by flesh color: red-fleshed kiwifruits had more iron and phosphorus, green-fleshed varieties contained more calcium and manganese, and yellow-fleshed fruits had higher levels of potassium, chlorine. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was optimized to visualize mineral distribution, revealing heterogeneous patterns of potassium, calcium, chlorine, sodium and boron in kiwifruits affected by soft rot. These findings underscore the potential of LA-ICP-MS as an effective tool for studying the distribution of nutrients in fruit and assessing its physiological disorders. The target hazard quotient (THQ) values of the mineral contents in all kiwifruit samples were below 1, indicating no significant risk of heavy metal contamination. Furthermore, agricultural practices such as fertilization and fungicide application influenced mineral content, with red-fleshed kiwifruits showing elevated copper and lead levels, likely from heavy metal-based disease and pest control agents. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of mineral diversity in kiwifruits and introduces a novel visual mapping technique, offering valuable insights into both the nutritional profile and safety of kiwifruit.
40022316	Pesticide residues in grapes and wine: An overview on detection, health risks, and regulatory challenges.	Grapes are fruits widely grown and known throughout the world, and they have significant economic and nutritional value. However, grapes are highly susceptible to attack by pests and insects, which reduces production and product quality. Pesticides are the most utilized solution for meeting global consumption demands and avoiding losses, and they can be used at any production stage. Although the benefits of using pesticides in grape production are evident, the prescribed limits must be observed to minimize their harmful effects on human health, as the accumulation of these compounds in the body over the long term can decrease life expectancy. This review of the literature intends to give a comprehensive analysis of pesticide residues in grape juice and wine, investigate analytical methodologies for pesticide detection, and set maximum residue limits (MRLs). Furthermore, the impacts of pesticide use and exposure to residues on the gut microbiota and adverse effects on human health were examined. Finally, insights into advances in detection and removal methods to mitigate the impact of pesticide residues in grape wine were presented. This review considers future perspectives in the field, including the development of safe and sustainable pesticides, with the improvement of international regulations to ensure food safety, aiming to expand pre-existing knowledge to provide more sustainable agricultural practices, encouraging global wine production. The target audience for this review includes researchers and academics, professionals in the agricultural and wine industry, regulators and government authorities, health professionals, and health and food safety-conscious consumers.
40022106	Cumulative risk assessment methodology applied to non-dietary exposures: developmental alterations in professional agricultural settings.	The safety assessment of combined exposure to xenobiotics has been an emerging topic for several years. Methodologies and approaches for cumulative risk assessment (CRA) are being developed primarily for the dietary risk assessment of pesticides, thus focusing only on consumer exposure. However, as highlighted in recent years, non-dietary exposures, such as those encountered by professionals in agricultural settings, may pose a significant risk due to their higher levels compared to dietary exposure. Despite this, existing methodologies for cumulative risk assessment (CRA) have not adequately addressed this critical aspect. In the EU, even if several legislations highlight the need to address the non-dietary CRA, no legal requirements are in place yet, therefore, there are no harmonized methodologies and approaches currently available. In a first step to fill this gap, this study is aimed at exploring CRA methodology applied to non-dietary exposure to pesticide in agricultural settings, specifically targeting operators, re-entry workers, and bystanders. The primary objective of the study was to verify the feasibility of an electronic register of plant protection treatments as data source for identifying and characterizing in field mixtures and consequently estimating cumulative non-dietary systemic exposure in real life. The relevant active substances selected for this investigation were those listed in foetal craniofacial alterations cumulative assessment groups (CAGs), established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for dietary CRA. Exposures to pesticides were estimated using European Union agreed mathematical models. The preliminary findings of this investigation effectively revealed the value of the register of treatments in assessing real-life plant protection products (PPP) usage in professional agricultural settings. In conclusion, the study provides encouraging insights into using the pesticide dietary CRA approach for non-dietary risk assessment in agricultural settings, underlining the necessity for further research and investigation of its feasibility for the evaluation of other acute effects but also for long-term effects related CAGs.
40021974	Evaluating malaria burden in children under-five and intervention outcomes in Tarkwa-Nsuaem municipality.	Malaria is a significant public health burden, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite global efforts to reduce malaria incidence, various challenges, including socio-economic disparities, insecticide resistance, and climatic factors, continue to hamper malaria elimination in Ghana. Over the years, several interventions have been implemented to combat malaria. However, the implementation of these malaria interventions and their association with the malaria burden remains unclear.
40021776	Assessment of antibacterial, nematicidal and herbicidal activities of Cautleya spicata (Sm.) Baker extracts, with chemical profiling using GC-MS.	The pesticidal activity of the rhizome and aerial parts of Cautleya spicata (Sm.) Baker was investigated, revealing significant findings. The GC-MS analysis revealed significant compositional variability among the extracts. β-Sitosterol was identified as the dominant compound in all extracts prepared with hexane, acetone, and methanol, while α-humulene was prominently present in the rhizome extracts. The methanolic extracts of C. spicata demonstrated substantial nematicidal activity against Meloidogyne incognita and herbicidal activity against seeds of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus (L.) (Radish) and Cichorium intybus L. (Chicory). Additionally, the extracts exhibited effective antibacterial activities against four bacterial strains, including Salmonella enterica serotype typhi, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. In-silico molecular docking studies identified stigmasterol as exhibiting the best binding affinities with the studied proteins. These results highlight the potential of C. spicata extracts as promising candidates for the development of botanical pesticides and antibacterial agents.
40021762	Fabrication of biosynthesized nickel ferrites nanoparticles and evaluation of their insecticidal efficacy on beetles (Blaps polychresta) testicular integrity.	Green synthesis of nanoparticles has emerged as a significant strategy to develop effective and eco-friendly insecticide agents to combat insecticide resistance and preserve environmental integrity and biodiversity. This study was thus designed to fabricate novel green synthesized NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (NiFe NPs) and investigate their potential insecticidal effects for the first time using Blaps polychresta beetle as an agricultural coleopteran pest model. Therefore, we prepared NiFe NPs following the hydrothermal synthesis procedure in the presence of lemon juice. The physiochemical characteristics of NiFe NPs were investigated employing SEM, TEM, FT-IR, XRD, TGA, VSM, and UV-Vis analysis. The lowest and most effective dose of NiFe NPs against male beetles was ascertained at a concentration of 0.03 mg/g body weight, reporting 67% mortality after 48 h. To study the insecticidal impact of NiFe NPs, EDX analysis demonstrated the bioaccumulation of NiFe NPs in testicular tissues of beetles, leading to pathophysiological consequences. Precisely, the oxidative stress incited by NiFe NPs led to disturbance of the antioxidant defense system, which was defined by augmentation of lipid peroxidation and suppression of antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, the comet assay exhibited remarkable DNA impairment, while flow cytometry analysis showed substantial cellular necrosis and apoptosis in NiFe NPs-treated beetles compared to control insects. In correlation with these findings, several aberrations in the histological and ultrastructure attributes of testicular tissues were perceived, including impaired follicular and cyst walls, deteriorated parietal cells, necrosis, and vacuolations. These results implied that NiFe NPs triggered oxidative injury in the testes, resulting in male reproductive system dysfunction. Altogether, our findings accentuate the potential application of NiFe NPs as nanopesticides, paving the way for the sustainable and cost-effective management of insect pests in agriculture.
40021755	Automated video-tracking analysis of Agriotes obscurus wireworm behaviour before, during and after contact with thiamethoxam- and imidacloprid-treated wheat seeds.	Limited studies have highlighted the importance of incorporating behavioural assessments into insecticide efficacy evaluations for wireworm pest control. "For this study, video tracking technology combined with a soil bioassay arena was employed to analyse the behaviour of Agriotes obscurus wireworms before, during, and after exposure to wheat seeds treated with the neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and imidacloprid at field-relevant concentrations. The analysis identified a set of behavioural key metrics for assessing the effects of these insecticides on wireworms. The results showed that these insecticides exhibited neutral attractancy towards wireworms. A brief period of feeding followed by rapid intoxication minimised damage to seeds. Furthermore, the wireworms demonstrated a specific form of behavioural resistance to neonicotinoids that did not rely on sensory input. In these insects, the rapid speed of intoxication, accompanied by drastic changes in behaviour, ensured that they received a sublethal rather than lethal dose of the insecticide. The wireworms fully recovered from all behavioural abnormalities within a week, and none died within 20 days following the exposure. In conclusion, this video tracking method provides a rapid and efficient means of assessing insecticides intended for wireworm management, offering valuable insights prior to more resource-intensive and costly field trials.
40021686	Enzymatic, cellular breakdown and lysis in treatment of Beauveria Brongniartii on Spodoptera litura (Fabricius, 1775).	The current study aimed to isolate Beauveria brongniartii conidia from forest soils, identify the fungus, and evaluate its effectiveness on the eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of Spodoptera litura. Insect mortality rates were recorded every 3, 6, 9, and 12 days. The identification of entomopathogenic fungi was carried out using molecular techniques, including PCR, DNA sequencing, and molecular markers, to detect species-specific 18 S rDNA genetic sequences, all performed under aseptic conditions. The results indicated that higher conidia concentrations (2.7 × 10<sup>9</sup> conidia/mL) exhibited greater virulence, with eggs showing a mortality rate of 98.66%, followed by larvae 96%, adults 90.66%, and pupae 77.33% after 12 days. Probit analysis revealed minimal LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> values: eggs (5.5 × 10<sup>2</sup>; 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> spores/mL), larvae (8.2 × 10<sup>2</sup>; 1.2 × 10<sup>7</sup> spores/mL), pupae (9.6 × 10<sup>4</sup>; 7.3 × 10<sup>10</sup> spores/mL), and adults (1.0 × 10<sup>3</sup>; 2.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> spores/mL). The total hemocyte counts and detailed observational results revealed that B. brongniartii induces cellular breakdown and cell lysis in S. litura larvae by producing enzymes that degrade the cuticle and cell membranes. Earthworm bioindicator studies showed minimal effects from B. brongniartii conidia compared to controls, while chemical treatments resulted in 96% mortality at 100 ppm. Histopathological examinations revealed no significant differences in gut tissue between earthworms treated with fungal conidia and those in the control group, unlike the substantial damage caused by chemical treatments. Biochemical analysis revealed significant alterations in enzyme activity, including reduced levels of phosphatase and catalase, as well as increased levels of lipid peroxides and superoxide dismutase. This study highlights the effectiveness of B. brongniartii in controlling S. litura, demonstrating its potential as a viable biocontrol agent and promoting eco-friendly alternatives to chemical pesticides, with no risk to non-target species or the environment.
40021523	Phenylpropanoids for the control of fungal diseases of postharvest fruit.	In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing greener and safer substances for the control of postharvest fungal diseases of fruit. Secondary metabolic pathways play an important role in plant defense responses, and the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway is one of the most important secondary metabolic pathways in plant defense. More and more studies have shown that exogenous phenylpropanoids treatments can inhibit postharvest fungal diseases. On the one hand, these biologically active phenylpropanoids are fungistatic and can act directly on the fungal cells infesting the postharvest fruit to inhibit spore germination and mycelial growth. On the other hand, phenylpropanoids treatment can improve plant resistance. In this review, we summarize recent achievements in the mechanisms and applications of phenylpropanoids, including cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid and esters, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and chlorogenic acid, in the inhibition of fungal pathogens and the reduction of postharvest losses. In addition, we propose further research hotspots and development directions based on combining nanomaterials and biotechnology.
40021331	Molecular chelating and shielding operation for organic photoelectrochemical transistor detection of chlorpyrifos.	Chlorpyrifos (CPF), as one of the four major insecticides for pest control, is widely used in agricultural production, but its continuous accumulation has caused serious pollution to the environment. In this paper, we developed a novel organic photoelectrochemical transistor (OPECT) sensor for the CPF detection using a BiOI@Bi<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> photogate. The molecular chelating of CPF with surface Bi(III) ions would induce the shielding effect that altered the OPECT response. With a high current gain at zero bias voltage, the as-developed OPECT device was able to detect CPF sensitively and specifically with a linear range of 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>-1 × 10<sup>2</sup> ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 0.03 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>. Meanwhile, the OPECT detection of CPF in water samples, lettuce and apple were also conducted, with the recoveries of 94.6%-103.1 % and the relative standard deviations (RSD) of 1.51%-4.26 % for the samples. This work reports a new OPECT strategy for CPF detection, which reveals the potential of OPECT for detecting other organophosphorus pesticides.
40021329	A Cu<sup>2+</sup>-triggered turn-on fluorescence non-enzymatic probe based on covalent organic framework for the detection of methyl parathion.	Methyl parathion, a potent organophosphorus insecticide, is extensively employed in agriculture and animal husbandry, leading to significant environmental contamination with pesticide residues, posing a grave threat to human health. This compound irreversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the human nervous system, resulting in the accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh), which is detrimental. Various enzyme activity-based assays have been explored due to its pathogenic mechanism, yet these methods are fraught with limitations. Thus, the development of a highly selective, sensitive, rapid, and effective method for detecting methyl parathion residues is crucial.
40020950	Oxidative stress induced by combined glyphosate and TBBPA exposure promotes gill autophagy and inflammation via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.	Glyphosate and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) are pollutants that pose a serious threat to the ecological safety of aquatic environments. However, there has been no report on the effects of combined exposure on the toxicity of carp fish gills in water. Therefore, we constructed a model of carp gill tissue and the carp epithelioma cells (EPC) cells exposed to glyphosate and/or TBBPA in vitro and in vivo, established a control group, a glyphosate group, a TBBPA group, and a glyphosate + TBBPA group, and added PI3K/AKT pathway activator musk ketone in vitro to verify the relationship between toxins and pathways. qRT-PCR and western blotting methods were used to detect the expression of oxidative stress-related indicators (CAT, GSH-Px, T-AOC, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and related genes. In vitro and in vivo results showed that glyphosate and/or TBBPA exposure resulted in overproduction of ROS, decreased activity of CAT, GSH-Px, T-AOC, and increased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content. Glyphosate and/or TBBPA exposure inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, further resulting in increased autophagy related genes LC3, ATG-5, Beclin-1, and decreased p62 expression. Inflammation related genes TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 increased. And it was more significant when exposed in combination than when exposed alone. The addition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activator musk ketone in vitro can significantly alleviate the changes of autophagy and inflammation-related indicators. In summary, glyphosate and/or TBBPA induce oxidative stress by promoting gill autophagy and inflammation via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
40020905	Effects of methoxychlor on broiler gut microbiota and liver and its residue accumulation risk to human health.	Methoxychlor as a persistent organic pollutant poses significant risks to human health and the environment. Most toxicological studies focus on high-dose exposures, which do not reflect typical chronic and low-dose human exposure, necessitating the examination of the cumulative effects of chronic exposure to persistent organic pollutants. Our study exposed broilers to different concentrations of p,p'-methoxychlor (0.01-5 mg/kg) in feed, reflecting the doses commonly used in agricultural practices. The results show that even at low doses, methoxychlor causes liver damage, metabolic disturbances, disrupts the intestinal microbiota, and leads to significant accumulation of residues, particularly in the liver. When methoxychlor contamination in the feed exceeds 0.01 mg/kg, residue levels in the broiler liver surpass the EU-established limit, and the residue levels in the broiler muscle surpass this limit when contamination exceeds 0.2 mg/kg. In addition, methoxychlor disrupts the gut microbiota, causing significant shifts in microbial composition, including a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in potentially harmful taxa. The gut dysbiosis, bioaccumulation potential of methoxychlor and changes in liver metabolic indicators may be associated with the liver pathology observed in this study, warranting further investigation. The harmful consequences significantly impact broiler production, leading to food safety concerns and risks to human health. At similar exposure levels, humans may face health risks comparable to those observed in broilers. This study provides important evidence for establishing strict regulations on methoxychlor residues in food products and assessing the potential risks of low-dose and long-term exposure to methoxychlor.
40020901	Concentrations of organic pollutants in seabirds from the tropical southwestern Atlantic Ocean are explained by differences in foraging ecology.	Persistent organic pollutants are a potential threat for marine vertebrates in both coastal and offshore areas. In this study, organic pollutants were evaluated in the blood and feathers of four seabird species that forage in the tropical southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Red-billed tropicbirds (Phaethon aethereus) and brown boobies (Sula leucogaster) were sampled in the Abrolhos Archipelago, 70 km from the coast, and used as proxies of nearshore contamination. The Trindade petrel (Pterodroma arminjoniana) was sampled on Trindade Island, 1200 km offshore, and the Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross (Thalassarche chlororhynchos) was sampled at sea, both used as proxies of pelagic contamination. Concentrations of organohalogen pesticides (∑OHP) and polychlorinated biphenyls (∑PCB) were generally higher in the booby, the most nearshore forager, followed by the tropicbird, petrel and the albatross. Carbon isotope values (δ<sup>13</sup>C) were positively associated with ∑OHP and ∑PCB in the blood of seabirds and explained 28.6% of the variation in pollutant data, suggesting higher concentrations of pollutants in the nearshore marine habitats, where δ<sup>13</sup>C is generally higher. Nitrogen isotope values (δ<sup>15</sup>N) also had a positive influence over pollutant concentrations and explained 13% of pollutant data, suggesting an influence of trophic level. Variations in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (∑PAH) concentrations among species, and relationships with isotopic values were less clear. Furthermore, the concentrations of organic pollutants were substantially higher in 2019 than 2022, which suggests greater environmental pollution in 2019 that could be related to urban and agricultural sources. Results demonstrate relationships between seabird ecology and organic pollutants in the tropical marine environment and highlight the importance of assessing multiple species in monitoring pollutant concentrations in wildlife.
40020900	Spatiotemporal distribution and fate of typical pesticides in the Bohai Sea and surrounding rivers, China.	Pesticide leakage has lasting and profound effects on the stability and health of marine ecosystems. To explore the occurrence, distribution, and fate of typical pesticides in marine environments, three sampling campaigns were conducted in the Bohai Sea and surrounding rivers. Atrazine was the most pronounced pesticide, with a high concentration and detection frequency in both seawater and sediment. The presence of typical organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) was significantly lower than historical levels. Pesticide concentrations decreased from inshore to offshore. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the pesticides highlighted the agricultural patterns and differences in pesticide use. Environmental factors and physicochemical properties jointly determined the behaviors and fates of pesticides in the marine environment. Sediment served as both a sink for widely used atrazine and a source of restricted OPs. Although some pesticides have been restricted or banned, such as dimethoate and chlorpyrifos, the risks caused by their long-term use and environmental accumulation cannot be ignored and the normalized monitoring of typical pesticides is necessary in the marine environment.
40020857	Lepas anatifera as a biomonitor of ocean health, ecological impacts, and cancer risk in a new frontier of exploration (Brazilian Equatorial Margin).	For the first time, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out to assess the presence of banned, restricted, and widely used permitted pesticides in Lepas anatifera, a globally distributed oceanic species. This study aims to shed light on ocean health along Brazil's equatorial margin, a region identified as a priority for future exploration. Additionally, it seeks to contribute to the understanding of the South Atlantic Ocean, a region with limited scientific studies, by evaluating the potential risks associated with the ingestion of these barnacles. Specifically, the study investigates their potential role in cancer development or disruptions to the endocrine system, considering their critical position within the oceanic food web. A total of 60 organic pollutant compounds were analyzed in 1903 individuals distributed in 19 sample groups of L. anatifera using gas chromatography (GC) equipped with both an electron capture detector (ECD) and a nitrogen-phosphorus detector (NPD) (GC-ECD/NPD). The highest total concentration of permitted pesticides in L. anatifera was triazines (Ʃ<sub>TPs</sub> = 2314.87 ng/g), followed by organophosphorus (Ʃ<sub>OPPs</sub> = 231.86 ng/g) and pyrethroids (Ʃ<sub>PPs</sub> = 32.45 ng/g). Among banned and restricted substances, organochlorine pesticides (Ʃ<sub>OCPs</sub> = 24.30 ng/g) had the highest concentrations, followed by polybrominated diphenyl ethers (Ʃ<sub>PBDEs</sub> = 10.23 ng/g) and polychlorinated biphenyls (Ʃ<sub>PCBs</sub> = 6.01 ng/g). The cancer risk from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) was considered insignificant or acceptable. L. anatifera is highlighted as an excellent oceanic biomonitor, demonstrating the ability to accumulate various traditional and emerging organic contaminants, necessitating improved waste management policies and monitoring plans. While PCBs and OCPs are well-known for causing severe diseases such as cancer, all the substances analyzed in this study have the potential to disrupt the endocrine and immune systems and impair reproductive functions. Some may even lead to feminization in animals, among other adverse health effects. These findings highlight the urgent need for effective policies and actions to improve the management of solid and liquid waste, alongside comprehensive plans to monitor the environmental fate of these substances and assess their true risks to living organisms.
40020850	Zein and resveratrol Schiff base nanocomplexes: An efficient delivery system to enhance the antibacterial efficacy of berberine.	Plant-derived bactericides with limited drug resistance and environmental friendliness are promising alternatives to traditional chemical bactericides. Berberine (BBR) is a natural product with excellent biological activity against bacteria. Novel pesticide delivery systems were designed and constructed based on the plant-derived zein resveratrol (RSV) and its derivative 4-((E)-((2-hydroxyphenyl)imino)methyl)-5-((E)-4-hydroxystyryl)benzene-1,3-diol (XF) to improve the efficacy of BBR. BBR@Zein-RSV and BBR@Zein-XF nanoparticles (NPs) had uniform dispersion and were approximately 119.19 and 86.82 nm, with encapsulation rates of 55.71 % and 83.34 %, respectively. BBR@Zein-RSV and BBR@Zein-XF NPs used dual pH and redox reaction mechanisms to achieve a controlled release into the environment. Especially, BBR@Zein-XF NPs exhibited antibacterial activity against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.98 mg/L. Additionally, it showed excellent protective (51.52 %) and curative (48.17 %) effects against rice bacterial leaf streaks. NPs could inhibit biofilm formation and extracellular polysaccharide production but promote reactive oxygen species levels, thereby destroying the integrity of bacteria and eventually leading to cell death. Proteomic analysis revealed that BBR@Zein-XF NPs regulated the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and lactoylglutathione lyase, thereby influencing plant growth, energy metabolism, and maintaining a normal redox state. This study provides new ideas for extensively utilizing plant-derived antibacterial agents by developing innovative and eco-friendly nano-pesticides.
40020845	Biodegradable poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)/polylactic acid mulching films containing glufosinate ammonium-loaded layered double hydroxide: Enhanced performance, herbicidal performance and extended functional life.	Biodegradable poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT)-based mulching films are currently attracting a lot of attention in the agricultural sector for boosting crops yields whilst preventing plastic waste accumulating in the environment. However, PBAT-based films are easily broken by weeds and then rapidly degrade resulting in a loss of moisture retention function. In this work, a series of PBAT/polylactic acid (PLA) mulching films containing glufosinate-ammonium-loaded nano layered double hydroxide nanosheets (Glu@LDH, with Glu loadings between 6 and 60 %) were successfully prepared. Results revealed that the addition of 3 wt% Glu@LDH (10 % Glu) to PBAT/PLA films resulted in improved mechanical and water vapor retention properties. Furthermore, the films showed an exceptional sustained release of Glu, which enhanced the weed control efficacy of the composite films and contributed to film longevity (76 days without any obvious damage to the surface of the films in weed control tests). This work demonstrates a simple way of extending the functional life of PBAT-based mulching films and thus holds significant importance for enhancing agricultural production efficiency, reducing production costs, safeguarding the environment, and fostering the sustainable development of agriculture.
40020815	Synergistic effects of bilayer edible coatings: Protein-based and cocoa butter/linseed oil formulation for enhanced food preservation.	High consumption of citrus, particularly oranges, coupled with significant postharvest losses due to microbial spoilage and physical damage have positioned them as a suitable model system for investigating the functional properties of novel active bilayer edible coatings. This study conceptualized a bilayer system comprising a protein-based inner layer for adhesion and a lipid-based outer layer enriched with cinnamon essential oil for enhanced barrier and antimicrobial properties. Optimization of the inner layer preparation, including adjusting soy protein/gelatine ratio, concentration, and solution pH, alongside gradual drying, resulting in a smooth, flexible film with improved barrier properties compared to neat soy protein and gelatine films. The second layer, formulated with cocoa butter and linseed oil incorporating cinnamon essential oil as a natural antimicrobial agent significantly enhanced barrier properties and exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against Penicillium spp. The obtained bilayer system demonstrated improved elongation at the break (exceeding 220 %) and a low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 0.98 g/(m<sup>2</sup>·h), comparable to commercial polymers like PLA and PA. This research demonstrates the potential of innovative and sustainable active bilayer coating to significantly reduce postharvest losses in citrus fruits while minimizing the reliance on synthetic fungicides.
40020791	Prostate as a target of endocrine disrupting chemicals: Relevance, pathways, assays.	Prostate, the main accessory gland of the male reproductive system, is a critical but yet overlooked target for Endocrine Disruptors (EDs), affecting the male reproductive system. Prostate is essential for male fertility; indeed, the prostatic fluid is the main component of seminal fluid, which is essential for the activation and capacitation of sperm cells. Furthermore, the prostate is tightly regulated by androgen signaling and is an important site for endocrine-related tumorigenesis. The following systematic review assesses and discusses the available literature evidence regarding the use of the androgen-dependent human prostate cell line LNCaP, in which up- or down-regulation of androgen signaling is assessed by measuring a clinically relevant marker, the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA). The data set is still limited: 30 articles, mainly dealing on natural substances and plant extracts, met the eligibility criteria. However, the results support the potential of the PSA assay testing on LNCaP cells in evaluating endocrine-related effects on prostate function as well as to identifying substances that may affect androgen-regulated pathways. Overall, the findings encourage further investigations with a broader range of substances with different modes of action.
40020615	A novel dual-mode colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescence method for detecting isocarbophos based on S, N-CDs inhibiting Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Cu-BTC nanozyme activity.	Although many colorimetric methods have been developed for on-site pesticide detection, most exhibit low sensitivity and limited resistance to interference. To address these issues, this study developed a novel dual-mode colorimetric-ratiometric fluorescence method for isocarbophos (ICP) detection using sulfur and nitrogen co-doped carbon nanodots (S, N-CDs) to inhibit catalytic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Cu-BTC nanozyme activity. The synthesized Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Cu-BTC nanozymes with higher peroxidase-like activity were inhibited by S, N-CDs. The inhibitory mechanism was deeply investigated and was ascribed to (1) the restriction of the reaction between Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Cu-BTC and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which decreased the ·OH production, and (2) the ·OH scavenging ability of the S, N-CDs, forming the basis of the dual-mode method. The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Cu-BTC/Apt-complementary strand (CS)/S, N-CDs hybridization complexes demonstrated minimal to no peroxidase-like activity, preventing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from oxidizing o-phenylenediamine (OPD) to produce yellow fluorescent 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). Meanwhile, the detection system demonstrated a low fluorescence intensity ratio (I<sub>575</sub>/I<sub>465</sub>) at an excitation wavelength of 390 nm. However, the presence of ICP caused the CS/S, N-CDs to separate from the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Cu-BTC/Apt due to the high affinity between Apt and ICP. Then, the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Cu-BTC/Apt-ICP complexes recovered peroxidase-like activity, which promoted DAP production, accompanied by a pronounced fluorescence intensity ratio (I<sub>575</sub>/I<sub>465</sub>). In optimum conditions, the detection limits (LODs) were 2.79 ng/mL (colorimetric) and 0.26 ng/mL (ratiometric fluorescence), respectively. The feasibility of the proposed method was verified via three spiked samples, yielding recovery rates of between 86.08 % and 112.64 %, indicating the significant potential for the highly sensitive, accurate on-site detection of ICP in actual samples.
40020588	Exposure to organophosphates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and pentachlorophenol: Spatial variations in urinary biomarkers and associations with oxidative stress based on a repeated-measure study.	It is important to identify priority regions regarding contaminant exposure, especially for environmental epidemiological studies. Whereas very few studies explored spatial variations in concentrations of multiple insecticide metabolites in the general population, as well as their relationship with oxidative stress biomarkers (OSBs). We determined related target analytes in urine samples (n = 850) from 425 healthy adults in six cities of China during both autumn and winter. Eight organophosphorus metabolites (mOPPs), three pyrethroid metabolites (mPYRs), nine neonicotinoid insecticide metabolites (mNNIs), and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were detected in the urine samples. Additionally, linear mixed-effects model and weighted quantile sum model were used to assess the individual and combined effects of the insecticide exposure on selected OSBs. Altogether, 17 out of the 21 analytes were widely detected (73.1-100%). The median specific gravity (SG)-adjusted concentrations for the mOPPs, mPYRs, mNNIs, and PCP were 1.17-4.85, 0.45-0.79, 0.09-1.07, and 0.38 ng/mL, respectively. The mOPPs in Lanzhou (northwest China), mPYRs and mNNIs in Dalian (northeast China), and PCP in Chengdu (southwest China) had the highest concentrations among the six cities. The concentrations of the mNNIs and PCP in urban areas were significantly higher than those in rural areas, while the concentrations of some mOPPs and mPYRs were higher in rural areas. The concentrations of most analytes were higher in autumn than in winter. Hazard quotient of >1 for chlorpyrifos was observed in 9.2% of the study participants, suggested a potential health risk, while the estimated daily intake values of the other analytes were lower than their chronic reference doses. Many of the insecticide exposure biomarkers were significantly associated with increased OSBs; among them, each interquartile range-fold increase in the insecticide exposure biomarkers was associated with 5.4-19.0%, 4.6-19.4%, and 12.4-83.3% increase in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-hydroxy guanosine, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-mercapturic acid, respectively. P-Nitrophenol was the main contributor in the association with the increased OSBs. This study found significant variations in insecticide exposure levels among different regions and seasons. The exposure level of chlorpyrifos suggested a potential health risk, and the insecticide mixture exposure was significantly associated with increased OSBs. Further risk assessments are warranted and control measures in the insecticide use are needed to mitigate the potential health risks.
40020491	Innovative paper-based SERS substrate for rapid detection and degradation of pesticides: Mechanistic insights and environmental applications.	Pesticide residues in agricultural products and environmental water pose significant threats to human health and ecosystems. The urgent need for rapid detection and degradation of complex samples containing multiple pesticides has driven advancements in detection methods. Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), a powerful molecular detection technique, has attracted considerable attention in food safety, environmental monitoring, and biological analysis due to its unparalleled sensitivity, non-destructive characterization capabilities, and high specificity. In this study, we presented a SERS detection substrate based on filter paper incorporating Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) and ZnO nanoparticles (ZnONPs). This innovative SERS substrate enables sensitive and recyclable detection of deltamethrin and atrazine pesticides. The detection limits for bromopropylate and atrazine were 38.87 μg/L and 39.35 μg/L, respectively. The method's detection limits meet the groundwater quality standards for allowable limits in agricultural water use. Notably, the paper-based SERS substrate achieved rapid degradation of pollutants within 10 min under UV light exposure, demonstrating its efficacy. Even after five consecutive uses, the substrate maintained its capability to detect various pesticides within mixed samples. This study explores the application of paper-based SERS detection technology in the investigation of pesticide degradation mechanisms and kinetics, discussing the effects of environmental conditions such as pH and temperature on the experimental results. The experimental findings support the theoretical research. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) models were used to study the hydrolysis evolution mechanisms of two pesticides under different pH conditions. Our study highlights that paper-based SERS detection technology is an effective method for studying the degradation mechanisms of pesticides. This innovative approach advances the understanding of pesticide degradation processes and opens avenues for further exploration.
40020385	Assessing the environmental risks of sulfonylurea pollutants: Insights into the risk priority and structure-toxicity relationships.	Sulfonylureas are widely used herbicides globally; however, the health risks associated with exposure to these compounds are poorly understood. This study used fuzzy clustering to categorize 44 sulfonylurea compounds into three risk priority levels (I, II, and III) and further investigated their structure-toxicity relationships. The order of the risk priority levels was level I＜level II＜level III. The pecking order of protein affinity was on the order of 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>, which was consistent with the order of the risk priority levels. Moreover, toxic conjugations induced significant changes in protein conformation, with high-risk sulfonylurea causing substantial conformational changes. Given that the conformations of sulfonylurea within the reactive domain were highly similar, the patterns of toxic actions were considerably similar as well. Structure-toxicity relationship analysis indicated a positive correlation among Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°), affinity between sulfonylurea and protein, logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient (logK<sub>ow</sub>), and risk priority. Specifically, a higher ΔG° value corresponded to stronger affinity, and a higher logK<sub>ow</sub> value corresponded to a higher environment risk. The electronegativity of the aromatic ring on the left side of the sulfonylurea molecule is a key determinant influencing affinity - higher electronegativity of this aromatic ring weakened the affinity of sulfonylurea for protein and reduced the risk. When the aromatic ring on the left side of sulfonylurea was consistent, an increase in the electronegativity of the heterocyclic ring on the right side resulted in a stronger affinity for protein and an increased risk. This study provides a mechanistic foundation for evaluating the health risks associated with exposure to sulfonylurea.
40020380	Defense mechanism of tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.) to tolfenpyrad reveals emerging role of melatonin in pesticide residue control.	Excessive use of pesticides has raised great concern on food safety as well as crop quality in the form of pesticide residues. Plants have natural defense mechanisms against pesticides for its alleviation. This study investigated distribution of tolfenpyrad as well as physiological, metabolomic, transcriptomic and hormonal responses of tea plants to tolfenpyrad application. Results show that tolfenpyrad tends to accumulate in tea leaves, with limited translocation to stems and roots after foliar application. While no significant change in plant biomass or growth status was apparent following tolfenpyrad application, it triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant system impacts. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal disrupted purine metabolism and nitrogen metabolism, mainly in amino acid pathways, with a glutathione (GSH) detoxification response. Hormonal and targeted metabolic profiling confirms a significant elevation in melatonin biosynthesis, then exogenous application of melatonin is proved to efficiently reduce pesticide residue in tea plants. This study improved our understanding of the tea plants' defense mechanism to pesticide, and suggested an emerging plant-derived regulator for improving quality and safety of tea products.
40020292	Elucidating the toxicity of methyl parathion, imazapic, isoxaflutole, and chlorantraniliprole on human hepatocarcinoma cells and bioinspired membranes.	Pesticides have boosted agricultural productivity but pose significant risks to environmental and human health. The intensification of agriculture has driven widespread pesticide use, with 66 % of global consumption allocated to sugarcane, soybean and corn. Sugarcane, a major monoculture in Brazil, India, and China, has driven a 700 % increase in pesticide use in Brazil over the past 40 years. Commonly used pesticides in Brazilian sugarcane farming include methyl parathion (PM), imazapic (IM), isoxaflutole (IS), and chlorantraniliprole (CL). Despite regulatory efforts by governmental agencies worldwide, the long-term toxicity of these substances on human health remains insufficiently studied. This study evaluates the cytotoxicity of PM, IM, IS, and CL at concentrations regulated by governmental agencies in human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells. Given the liver's role in metabolizing xenobiotics, it is especially vulnerable to pesticide-toxicity. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase release) assays, alongside confocal microscopy, showed reduced cell viability and impaired membrane integrity, with progressive toxicity (from 24 to 96 h), primarily impacting mitochondrial activity. Surface pressure-area (π-A) isotherms, compressibility (C<sub>S</sub>⁻¹), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed distinct pesticide incorporation mechanisms into Langmuir monolayers of HepG2 lipid extracts, used as membrane models. The findings underscore the hepatotoxicity of PM, IM, IS, and CL, even at concentrations regulated by governmental agencies, emphasizing their potential human health hazards.
40020065	MSB2-activated pheromone pathway regulates fungal plasma membrane integrity in response to herbicide adjuvant.	Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are used worldwide for weed management. However, GBHs pose a threat to soil fungal community, although fungi can degrade and use glyphosate as a nutrient source. How fungi respond to GBHs remains enigmatic. Here, we found that, not as in plants, the commercial GBH Roundup does not target the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the soil-derived fungus <i>Trichoderma guizhouense</i>, whereas it impairs fungal growth. We demonstrate that the herbicide adjuvant Triton CG-110 is more toxic to fungal cells than pure glyphosate. It limits nitrogen uptake, which induces the expression of proteinase YPS1 to catalyze the shedding of the MSB2 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of the MAPK TMK1 pheromone pathway. The downstream B2H2-type transcription factor STE12 directly regulates ergosterol biosynthesis, affecting membrane fluidity and stability. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that the pheromone pathway is implicated in ergosterol biosynthesis and plasma membrane integrity.
40019794	Microbial Cytotoxic Effect of <sup>212</sup>Pb in Radiopharmaceuticals.	<b><i>Background:</i></b> The cytotoxic effect of <sup>212</sup>Pb on microbial growth was examined, using six microorganisms, at clinically relevant time points, to determine the potency of <sup>212</sup>Pb as a self-sterilizing agent in radiopharmaceuticals using [<sup>212</sup>Pb]Pb-DOTAMTATE. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Vials of radiolabeled [<sup>212</sup>Pb]Pb-DOTAMTATE, nonradiolabeled DOTAMTATE, and appropriate media were inoculated with <i>Bacillus spizizenii</i>, <i>Candida albicans, Clostridium sporogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus,</i> or <i>Aspergillus brasiliensis</i>. Samples from each vial type were plated onto tryptic soy agar or Sabouraud dextrose plates and allowed to grow at optimal temperature for each strain to obtain quantifiable colony forming units (CFU). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Each microbial organism observed at least a 6 log reduction in total CFUs after 6 h of exposure to [<sup>212</sup>Pb]Pb-DOTAMTATE drug product vials, showing no remaining colonies as compared to the vials containing only media and drug formulation with no radiolabeled material, utilizing a low absorbed dose of no greater than 1.01 kGy. A sterility assessment of the two [<sup>212</sup>Pb]Pb-DOTAMTATE drug product vials containing the lowest total CFUs per vial displayed no microbial growth upon incubation for 14 d. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This study suggests that <sup>212</sup>Pb in radiopharmaceuticals is a potent microbial cytotoxic agent with self-sterilizing properties.
40019624	Understanding the adsorption mechanism of geosmin, linalool, and o-cresol on Machilis hrabei olfactory receptor MhOR5 via statistical physics modeling and molecular docking simulation.	This article suggests that the olfaction process can be simplified to an adsorption mechanism by utilizing the Machilis hrabei olfactory receptor MhOR5 as a biological adsorbent. The odorant molecules such as geosmin, linalool, and o-cresol were used as adsorbates. The aim of the present study is to provide new insights into the docking process of the tested odorants on MhOR5 using numerical simulation via an advanced statistical physics model to fit the corresponding response curves.
40019385	Nanomediated Stimulation: An Alternative to Brassinolide Hormone Replacement Therapy for Plant Resistance Activation.	Facing harsher losses of crop yield due to virus infection, it is critical to reduce yield loss by improving plants' disease resistance. Here, we proposed using nanoparticles to prestimulate <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> as a nanomediated brassinolide (BR) hormone replacement therapy to trigger immune responses and subsequently increase plant immunity against viruses. Our results showed the prestimulated leaves of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) exhibit accelerated antiviral capability, and the plant resistance activation was increased with a decrease in the ZnONP size. Transcriptome data and hormone assays revealed that ZnONP stimulation activated the brassinolide hormone signaling pathway and increased the brassinolide concentration. Importantly, the induced activity of ZnONPs on antiviral capability could be eliminated by virus-mediated silencing of key genes of brassinolide in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. In summary, we showed prestimulated plants with ZnONPs induced systemic resistance to TMV by activating the brassinolide pathways. This simple nanostimulant-based hormone replacement therapy may alleviate pathogen infection in crop plants and reduce the need for pesticides.
40018989	Laboratory evaluation of drugs/systemic insecticides as endectocides through membrane feeding method: a unique approach for the control of mosquito vectors.	Insecticide resistance, changing vector feeding behavior, and zoonotic transmission are key challenges for current vector control strategies. Use of endectocide drugs/systemic insecticides is a novel vector control strategy by the World Health Organization (WHO). We evaluated the efficacy of different concentrations of endectocide drugs/systemic insecticides against Anopheles stephensi and Culex quinquefasciatus by membrane blood feeding method. Experiment was conducted using 5-7 days old female mosquito in a VCRC-ANM feeder. Mortality, survival duration, and fecundity of tested mosquitoes post blood feeding was listed up to 7 days. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to visually analyze mosquito survival duration.
40018959	Detection and selection of dye-degrading bacteria from surface waters with different degrees of contamination.	Biodegradability and resistance from indigenous bacterial communities to dyes were tested using samples from both polluted and unpolluted surface waters in Buenos Aires. Five dyes were selected for the study: Acid Black 210, Direct Orange 39, Malachite Green, Gentian Violet, and Alizarin Red. Water quality was assessed by measuring chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, and both <i>Escherichia coli</i> and enterococci counts. Biodegradability was tested using a respirometric method, while resistance was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). No bacterial strains capable of degrading the dyes as the sole carbon source were isolated from the respirometric tests. However, from the MIC tests, 28 strains capable of dye discolouration were identified, using nutrient broth as a supplement. Two of them were able to degrade Malachite Green and Acid Black 210 at a concentration of 50 mg L<sup>-1</sup> in less than 24 h and with an efficiency greater than 87%. These strains were identified as <i>Aeromonas</i> sp. and <i>Shewanella</i> sp. through MALDI-TOF/MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The determination of biodegradability and resistance can be used to enhance the characterization of watercourses. Furthermore, this methodology provides a means to isolate biodegrading bacteria that could be applied in effluent treatment processes.
40018852	Herbivore-induced maize volatiles: dual functions in repelling fall armyworm and attracting natural enemies.	Since its invasion of China, the fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) has rapidly become a major threat to maize production, raising significant concerns about national food security. This study investigates the effects of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), released by maize in response to FAW larval infestation, on the oviposition behavior of female FAW.
40018799	EAACI Guidelines on Environmental Science for Allergy and Asthma-Recommendations on the Impact of Indoor Air Pollutants on the Risk of New-Onset Asthma and on Asthma-Related Outcomes.	The EAACI Guidelines used the GRADE approach to evaluate the impact of major indoor air pollutants (dampness and mould, cleaning agents, volatile organic compounds and pesticides) on the risk of new-onset asthma and on asthma-related outcomes. The guideline also acknowledges the synergies among indoor air pollutants and other components of the indoor exposome (allergens, viruses, endotoxins). Very low to low certainty of evidence was found for the association between exposure to indoor pollutants and increased risk of new-onset asthma and asthma worsening. Only for mould exposure there was moderate certainty of evidence for new-onset asthma. Due to the quality of evidence, conditional recommendations were formulated on the risk of exposure to all indoor pollutants. Recommendations are provided for prevention, patient care and mitigation in a framework supporting rational decisions for healthcare professionals and patients to individualize and improve asthma management. For policymakers and regulators this evidence-informed guideline supports setting legally binding standards and goals for indoor air quality at international, national and local levels. Asthma management counselled by the current EAACI guidelines can improve asthma-related outcomes but community and governmental measures for improved indoor air quality are needed to achieve significant impact.
40018670	Synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles using <i>Trichoderma harzianum</i> and its bio-efficacy on <i>Alternaria brassicae</i>.	Increasing concerns about chemical fungicides require sustainable alternatives for crop protection. Microbe-mediated synthesis of metal nanoparticles offers a sustainable, eco-friendly and highly effective strategy for plant disease management. This study investigates the mycosynthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using the culture filtrate of <i>Trichoderma harzianum</i> and their antifungal activity against <i>Alternaria brassicae</i>. Nanoparticles were synthesized under optimized conditions of cell-free culture filtrate (CFCF) concentration, substrate concentration, pH and temperature. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy confirmed an absorption peak between 200 and 400 nm, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms the hexagonal crystal structure with an average size of 29 nm. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analysis revealed a hydrodynamic size of 50.79 nm and a surface charge of -17.49 mV, indicating good stability. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis identified functional groups (C=O, N-O, and O-H) that are crucial for nanoparticles stabilization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis revealed spherical, rod-shaped and hexagonal nanoparticles with sizes between 12 and 41 nm. Mycogenic-zinc oxide nanoparticles (M-ZnO NPs) significantly inhibited the mycelial growth of <i>A. brassicae</i> by 91.48% at 200 μg/mL, compared to chemically synthesized ZnO NPs at 200 μg/mL (79.62%) and mancozeb 0.2% (82.96%). SEM-EDX analysis revealed deformations and absorption of M-ZnO NPs in fungal hyphae, while confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and impaired membrane integrity in treated fungal cells. Stress enzyme analysis confirmed increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity by 44.2 U/mol and 39.6 U/mol at 200 μg/mL M-ZnO NPs. Our studies suggest that the M-ZnO NPs synthesized with <i>T. harzianum</i> culture filtrate have increased antifungal activity even at lower doses and can be used as an alternative to traditional fungicides without affecting environment.
40018116	Addressing challenges in vector control: a review of current strategies and the imperative for novel tools in India's combat against vector-borne diseases.	Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) exert a substantial burden across the world, especially in tropical countries. Malaria, chikungunya, dengue, visceral leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis and Japanese encephalitis are among the public health concerns for India. One of the major pillars for the containment of VBDs is vector control and different tools have been employed for several decades. These range from chemical insecticides used in indoor residual sprays, space sprays, fogging, treated bednets and larvicides to biological control methods such as larvivorus fishes and environmental control and modification measures such as source reduction. However, these methods are increasingly becoming less effective due to several reasons such as insecticide resistance, outdoor biting, behavioural changes in vectors for biting and resting, climate change, movement of population, vector incursion to newer areas and others. It is essential to develop and test new tools for vector control to surmount these challenges. Though focusing on India's public health concerns, the new tools enumerated here can be tested by any country with similar epidemiological and environmental conditions. The promising new vector control tools are insecticide-treated nets with synergist and/or pyrrole chlorfenapyr, alternatives/additions to synthetic pyrethroids like neonicotinoids, clothianidin for indoor residual spray, newer formulations such as <i>Bacillus sphaericus</i> for use in larvicides, attractive toxic sugar baits, especially to curtail outdoor transmission, endectocides like ivermectin for use in animals/humans, insecticidal paints, spatial repellents, insecticide-treated wearables and others. Genetic modification technologies (Sterile Insect Technique/Incompatible Insect Technique/Wolbachia transfection) are also upcoming strategies. Among the six VBDs, India is committed to the elimination of three (malaria, visceral leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis) and it will require additional and/or novel tools to overcome the roadblocks in our current journey to the goal of control/elimination of these VBDs.
40017643	Environmental innovation: polyaniline-cuttlebone nanocomposite as a potent antimicrobial agent and a synergistic barrier against doxorubicin-induced toxicity.	This work emphasizes the importance of utilizing cuttlebone waste as a sustainable solution for waste management and the development of antimicrobial materials by incorporating it as a supporting phase for polyaniline (PANI) to form a nanocomposite. The three prepared materials were fully characterized using various techniques, including FTIR, XRD, SEM, EDX for elemental analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements, particle size distribution analysis, and zeta potential measurements. The study focuses on the development of novel molecules with potential antibacterial and antifungal activity against clinical pathogens responsible for infectious diseases. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the polyaniline/cuttlebone (PANI/CB) composite were evaluated using methods such as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and disk diffusion for bacterial samples, as well as MIC, minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), antifungal percentage, and disk diffusion for fungal samples. Notably, the PANI/CB composite exhibited a distinct crystallite size and characteristic XRD pattern, along with a significant BET surface area, demonstrating strong antimicrobial properties. Cuttlebone not only serves as a bioactive agent but also acts as a sustainable support to enhance the properties of polyaniline, forming a nanocomposite with a low MIC range (8-66 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>) and effective action against Gram-positive bacteria such as <i>S. aureus</i>, although it showed less susceptibility against Gram-negative bacteria like <i>E. coli</i>. The MTT assay results demonstrated that while PANI and CB alone exhibited minimal cytotoxicity on Huh7 cells, the combination of doxorubicin (DOX) with PANI/CB significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect, suggesting a synergistic interaction that could improve the therapeutic efficacy of DOX. Additionally, the effectiveness of the polyaniline/cuttlebone composite in protecting against DOX-induced hepatic and renal damage in rats was evaluated. Tissue damage was assessed using serum markers such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), urea, and creatinine. The results demonstrated a decrease in oxidative damage and significant improvements in liver and kidney function markers in the polyaniline/cuttlebone-treated groups compared to those treated with individual components. Specifically, ALT levels decreased from 48 ± 2.8 IU L<sup>-1</sup> to 21 ± 0.4 IU L<sup>-1</sup>, AST from 195 ± 0.7 IU L<sup>-1</sup> to 13 ± 1.08 IU L<sup>-1</sup>, urea from 86 ± 1.4 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> to 39 ± 0.7 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>, and creatinine from 1.05 ± 0.03 mg dL<sup>-1</sup> to 0.53 ± 0.01 mg dL<sup>-1</sup>. These findings highlight the potential of utilizing cuttlebone waste as a sustainable material in antimicrobial applications, offering an eco-friendly solution for waste management while contributing to the development of potent antimicrobial nanocomposites.
40017590	Exploring Ternary Essential Oil Mixtures of Moroccan Artemisia Species for Larvicidal Effectiveness Against <i>Culex pipiens</i> Mosquitoes: A Mixture Design Approach.	Essential oils (EOs) have gained significant attention for their biopesticidal properties in pest management. This study investigates the insecticidal potential of EOs extracted from the aerial parts of three indigenous <i>Artemisia</i> species-<i>Artemisia absinthium</i>, <i>Artemisia arborescens</i>, and <i>Artemisia campestris</i>-collected from various provenances in Morocco. The EOs were tested individually and in combination against <i>Culex pipiens</i> (<i>C. pipiens</i>) larvae to explore potential synergistic interactions using a mixture design methodology. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) analyses revealed quantitative and qualitative variations in the chemical composition of the oils. The primary constituents of <i>A. absinthium</i> were identified as thujone (32.20% ± 2.65%), camphor (19.95% ± 2.64%), and chamazulene (19.58% ± 2.33%). In <i>A. arborescens</i>, thujone (52.05% ± 3.84%), camphor (10.71% ± 3.08%), and eucalyptol (4.79% ± 1.53%) were the major components, while <i>A. campestris</i> comprised camphor (18.98% ± 2.65%), car-3-en-5-one (11.25% ± 2.33%), and thujone (6.63% ± 1.67%). When applied individually, all three EOs exhibited significant larvicidal activity against <i>C. pipiens</i> larvae, with <i>A. arborescens</i> showing the highest efficacy (LC<sub>50</sub> 11.11 <i>μ</i>g/mL (5.45 ± 22.62)) compared to <i>A. absinthium</i> (LC<sub>50</sub>: 16.98 <i>μ</i>g/mL (6.73 ± 27.39)) and <i>A. campestris</i> (LC<sub>50</sub>: 19.07 <i>μ</i>g/mL (13.57 ± 23.38)). In mixture experiments, the mixture design outcomes reveal that the ternary formulation comprising 58% <i>A. absinthium</i>, 26% <i>A. arborescens</i>, and 16% <i>A. campestris</i> emerged as the most effective blend, achieving complete larval eradication. This study highlights the potential of <i>Artemisia</i> EO combinations as a sustainable and effective alternative for managing mosquito vectors of disease.
40017582	Rejection of malathion by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes exposed to foulant and two clean-in-place procedures.	This research tested the treatment efficacy of an Energy Savings Nanofiltration 1 Low Fouling (ESNA 1-LF) nanofiltration (NF) and an Energy Saving Polyamide 2 (ESPA2) reverse osmosis (RO) membrane for removing malathion from water. Both membranes are of composite polyamide construction. The study included measuring malathion rejection using both pristine membranes and membranes exposed to a simulated secondary wastewater effluent foulant before and after two types of clean-in-place procedures. Across all conditions studied, malathion rejection ranged from 84 to 95% for the ESNA1-LF NF membrane and 77 to 94% for the ESPA2 RO membrane. Contact angle measurements were also collected for each membrane exposure condition. While the contact angle measurements indicated changes to the hydrophobicity of the selective layer of the membranes, they did not correlate to changes in the performance of malathion rejection. As expected, it was observed that malathion rejection improved with the introduction of foulant. Also, the clean-in-place procedures helped restore flux while maintaining malathion rejection.
40017298	Computer-Aided Design and Pharmacophore-Based Screening of a Diverse Combinatorial Library of Phytoselective Aryloxyacetic Acid Derivatives as HPPD Inhibitors.	We investigated the inhibitory potency of aryloxyacetic acid derivatives (AADs) on 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), a crucial enzyme target for HPPD herbicide development. Developing a wide-ranging approach combining reported structure-activity relationships (SARs with the observed inhibitory potencies of the enzyme <i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup>), our simulations for molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann (MM-PB) complexation quantitative SAR (QSAR) (computed relative Gibbs free energies of the HPPD-AADx complex formation ΔΔ<i>G</i><sub>com</sub>), and three-dimensional (3D)-QSAR pharmacophore (PH4) models for screening the chemical subspace of aryloxyacetic acid derivatives (a virtual library of AADs, VL), we come out with a handful of novel AADs with promising predictive HPPD inhibitory potency and confirmed molecular dynamics (MD) conformational stability. The 3D-QSAR model revealed a correlation (p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup> = <i>a</i> × ΔΔ<i>G</i><sub>com</sub> + <i>b</i>) between computed data and observed inhibition ones: p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup> = -0.0544 × ΔΔ<i>G</i><sub>com</sub> + 6.93, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.87 for a training set (TS) of 30 AAD (AAD1-30). The subsequent 3D-QSAR pharmacophore (PH4) of HPPD inhibition by AADs confirmed the correlation (p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup> = 0.863 × p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>pre</sup> + 7.92, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.86) between PH4-predicted p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>pre</sup> and the observed ones p<i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>exp</sup>. The structural information derived from these models suggested suitable substituents for building a virtual library (VL) of AAD analogues representing a chemical subspace of 79,500 compounds to be PH4-screened in search of more potent inhibitors; the best predicted <i>K</i><sub>i</sub><sup>pre</sup> of them reached 40 pM. Finally, the good stability of the <i>At</i>HPPD-AADx complex and the flexibility of the active conformation of the inhibitor for selected top-ranked AAD analogues were checked with the help of molecular dynamics (MD, 200 ns runs). This computational study proposed a set of new predicted potent inhibitors with herbicidal effects.
40016872	Transcriptome and nutritional composition analysis of stacked transgenic maize with insect resistance and herbicide tolerance.	The safety assessment of stacked transgenic crops is essential for their commercial cultivation. A crucial element of safety assessment is the nutritional evaluation of transgenic crops. Currently, profiling methods like transcriptome are employed as supplemental analytical tools to find the unintended effects of transgenic crops. In this study, stacked transgenic maize ZDRF8×nCX-1 was produced by crossing of two transgenic maize events ZDRF8 and nCX-1. This stacked transgenic maize expresses five genes: <i>cry1Ab</i>, <i>cry2Ab</i> and <i>g10evo-epsps</i> (from ZDRF8), as well as <i>cp4 epsps</i> and <i>P450-N-Z1</i> (from nCX-1). Molecular analysis showed that the insertion sites of target genes were not changed during stack breeding, and the target genes are effectively expressed at both RNA and protein levels in ZDRF8×nCX-1. Target trait analysis showed that ZDRF8×nCX-1 exhibits tolerant to glyphosate, flazasulfuron and MCPA, and is resistant to damage by corn borers. Transcriptome analysis revealed that gene-stacked maize ZDRF8×nCX-1 did not significantly alter transcriptome profiles compared to the transgenic maize events ZDRF8 and nCX-1. Nutritional composition analysis showed that the grain profile of ZDRF8×nCX-1 was substantially equivalent to that of the non-transgenic counterpart. These results suggest that hybrid stacking does not cause significantly unintended effects beyond providing the intended beneficial traits.
40016276	Resistance development in pink bollworm (Pectinophora Gossypiella Saunders) against Bt cotton and its' establishment as mid season pest in India.	The pink boll worm now became a menace for sustainable cultivation of Bt cotton in India. Based on the data recorded in unsprayed conditions at 13 different locations of north, central and south cotton growing zone between 2007 and 2023, initiation of green boll damage during later part of the season was observed on Bt cotton genotype during 2009-2014 wherein incidence of PBW already existed on non-Bt genotype. In our research, between 2014 and 2017, the central and southern regions of India experienced a rise in the survival of pink bollworms on Bt cotton surpassing the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) whereas in the north zone PBW incidence started in 2018 at experimental locations. The data validate the initial success of Bt/BG-II cotton in its first ten years (2002-2013) of introduction including pink bollworm, which caused negligible green boll damage (0-1.03%) on Bt/BG-II genotypes, while the incidence on non-Bt genotypes was much higher (2.5-23.01%). Following that, an establishment phase was detected in 2014, confirmed by the equal presence of pink boll worm in BG-II and non-Bt, with minimal infestation differences in BG-II and non-Bt, indicating a larger presence of resistant individuals. Following 2014, the coexistence of PBW in BG-II and non-Bt populations was noted concurrently, with a gradual increase in incidence over ETL beginning in the middle of the season. Farmer's field surveys reported highest number of locations above ETL during 2017 with a decreasing trend both in central and south zone. In the north, infestations were low until 2021, but increased significantly, reaching their highest point in 2023. The emergence and spread of PBW resistance to Bt cotton, facilitated by off-season survival and carryover, poses a substantial threat to the sustainability of BG-II cotton cultivation in India.
40016270	Base-line susceptibility of Tribolium castaneum to various synthetic insecticides.	The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) is a cosmopolitan insect pest that causes severe loss in broad range of stored commodities worldwide. Chemical control has been considered as major preventive measure to manage this dangerous pest. Therefore, we have evaluated 22 different insecticides against T. castaneum collected from five districts of southern Punjab, Pakistan. Bioassays were performed to assess the LC<sub>50</sub> values of considered insecticides. Our results showed that emamectin benzoate was the most toxic insecticide among all the insecticides. There was non-significant difference in toxicity of deltamethrin and triazophos to all tested populations based on overlapping 95% confidence interval of LC<sub>50</sub>. The spinosad was more toxic as compared with the spinetoram. In case of ketoenoles, spirotetramat was more toxic as compared with the spiromesifen. In case of acetamaprid and nitenpyram, there is non- significant difference in LC<sub>50</sub> values of the all tested strains of T. castaneum based on overlapping 95%CI. We used four insect growth regulators (IGRS) including methoxyfenozide, pyriproxyfen, lufenuron and cyromazine as larvicides. The lufenuron was more toxic as compared with the pyriproxyfen, methoxyfenozide and cyromazine in most of the studied populations. Methoxyfenozide was moderately toxic. These results will provide help in establishing an effective management program for T. castaneum.
40016246	Rational design of phytovirucide inhibiting nucleocapsid protein aggregation in tomato spotted wilt virus.	Ineffectiveness of managing plant viruses by chemicals has posed serious challenges in crop production. Recently, phase separation has shown to play a key role in viral lifecycle. Using inhibitors that can disturb biomolecular condensates formed by phase separation for virus control has been reported in medical field. However, the applicability of this promising antiviral tactic for plant protection has not been explored. Here, we report an inhibitor, Z9, that targets the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) N protein. Z9 is capable of interacting with the amino acids in the nucleic acid binding region of TSWV N, disrupting the assembly of N and RNA into phase-separated condensates, the reduction of which is detrimental to the stability of the N protein. This study provides a strategy for phase separation-based plant virus control.
40016229	Domesticated rice alters the rhizosphere microbiome, reducing nitrogen fixation and increasing nitrous oxide emissions.	Crop domestication has revolutionized food production but increased agriculture's reliance on fertilizers and pesticides. We investigate differences in the rhizosphere microbiome functions of wild and domesticated rice, focusing on nitrogen (N) cycling genes. Shotgun metagenomics and real-time PCR reveal a higher abundance of N-fixing genes in the wild rice rhizosphere microbiomes. Validation through transplanting rhizosphere microbiome suspensions shows the highest nitrogenase activity in soils with wild rice suspensions, regardless of planted rice type. Domesticated rice, however, exhibits an increased number of genes associated with nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) production. Measurements of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in soils with wild and domesticated rice are significantly higher in soil with domesticated rice compared to wild rice. Comparative root metabolomics between wild and domesticated rice further show that wild rice root exudates positively correlate with the frequency and abundance of microbial N-fixing genes, as indicated by metagenomic and qPCR, respectively. To confirm, we add wild and domesticated rice root metabolites to black soil, and qPCR shows that wild rice exudates maximize microbial N-fixing gene abundances and nitrogenase activity. Collectively, these findings suggest that rice domestication negatively impacts N-fixing bacteria and enriches bacteria that produce the greenhouse gas N<sub>2</sub>O, highlighting the environmental trade-offs associated with crop domestication.
40016198	Environmentally Friendly Sustained-Release Antifungal Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complex Nanofibers for Controlling Fungi.	The development of hydrophobic pesticide formulations remains constrained by complicated manufacturing processes, excessive reliance on organic solvents, and indispensable surfactants. The practical application of dimethomorph (DIM) is hindered by its hydrophobic nature, posing risks to nontarget organisms. Inspired by the uptake of nanomaterials by plants, DIM was encapsulated in the cyclodextrin (CD) cavity to optimize its water-solubility and the sustained-release rate. The spatial confinement effect of CD could facilitate the thermostability of DIM. DIM/CD inclusion complex solutions were electrospun to fabricate nanofibers with bead-free and smooth morphology. As predicted, the release of DIM/CD inclusion complex nanofibers reached plateaus with accumulative release values of approximately 75%. The antifungal activity of DIM/CD inclusion complex nanofibers possesses much higher than DIM for controlling <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> and <i>Haematonectria hematococco</i>, thereby enhancing its antifungal bioactivity and reducing pesticide spraying frequency. The inhibition rates of <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> by DIM/HPβCD and DIM/HPγCD inclusion complex nanofibers are found to be 55.8% and 53.6% within 144 h, respectively. This work explores the feasibility of inclusion of complex nanofibers as a delivery platform for application in sustained agriculture production.
40016167	Atrazine's effects on mammalian physiology.	Atrazine is a chlorotriazine herbicide that is one of the most widely used herbicides in the USA and the world. For over 60 years atrazine has been used on major crops including corn, sorghum, and sugarcane to control broadleaf and grassy weed emergence and growth. Atrazine has exerted a major economic and environmental impact over that time, resulting in reduced production costs and increased conservation tillage practices. However, widespread use and a long half-life led to a high prevalence of atrazine in the environment. Indeed, atrazine is the most frequent herbicide contaminant detected in water sources in the USA. Due to its almost ubiquitous presence and questions regarding its safety, atrazine has been well-studied. First reported to affect reproduction with potential disruptive effects which were later linked to the immune system, cancer, stress response, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular ailments in experimental models. Atrazine impact on multiple interwoven systems broadens the significance of atrazine exposure. The endeavor to uncover the mechanisms underlying atrazine-induced dysfunction in mammals is ongoing, with new genetic and pharmacological targets being reported. This review aims to summarize the prominent effects of atrazine on mammalian physiology, primarily focusing on empirical studies conducted in lab animal models and establish correlations with epidemiological human studies when relevant. In addition, current common patterns of toxicity and potential underlying mechanisms of atrazine action will be examined.
40015937	Effects of glyphosate, antibiotics, and an anticoccidial drug on pancreatic gene expression and blood physiology in broilers.	Drugs and pesticide residues in broiler feed can compromise the therapeutic and production benefits of antibiotic (ANT) application and affect gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the expression of 13 key pancreatic genes and blood physiology parameters after administering one maximum residue limit of herbicide glyphosate (GLY), two ANTs, and one anticoccidial drug (AD). A total of 260 Ross 308 broilers aged 1‍-‍40 d were divided into the following four groups of 65 birds each: control group, which was fed the main diet (MD), and three experimental groups, which were fed MD supplemented with GLY, GLY+ANTs (enrofloxacin and colistin methanesulfonate), and GLY+AD (ammonium maduramicin), respectively. The results showed that the addition of GLY, GLY+ANTs, and GLY+AD caused significant changes in the expression of several genes of physiological and economic importance. In particular, genes related to inflammation and apoptosis (interleukin 6 (<i>IL6</i>), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (<i>PTGS2</i>), and caspase 6 (<i>CASP6</i>)) were downregulated by up to 99.1%, and those related to antioxidant protection (catalase (<i>CAT</i>), superoxide dismutase 1 (<i>SOD1</i>) and peroxiredoxin 6 (<i>PRDX6</i>)) by up to 98.6%, compared to controls. There was also a significant decline in the values of immunological characteristics in the blood serum observed in the experimental groups, and certain changes in gene expression were concordant with changes in the functioning of the pancreas and blood. The changes revealed in gene expression and blood indices in response to GLY, ANTs, and AD provide insights into the possible mechanisms of action of these agents at the molecular level. Specifically, these changes may be indicative of physiological mechanisms to overcome the negative effects of GLY, GLY+ANTs, and GLY+AD in broilers.
40015912	The UDP-glycosyltransferase UGT352A3 contributes to the detoxification of thiamethoxam and imidacloprid in resistant whitefly.	Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferases are essential phase-II detoxification enzymes that glycosylate lipophilic endogenous and xenobiotic compounds and they are thought to play a role in driving the evolution of insecticide resistance. To examine if the resistance to thiamethoxam and imidacloprid was associated with enhancement of UDP-glycosyltransferase in the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, we first conducted UDP enzyme activity assays in resistant and sensitive strains in the absence and presence of UGT inhibitors. We found that the UGT enzyme content of resistant whitefly was significantly 5.02- to 10.69-fold higher than that of sensitive whitefly. Individual UGT inhibitors effectively inhibited UGT activity in resistant strains and their effect was synergistic when applied in combination. We then used bioinformatic, molecular, genetic and in silico approaches to determine if UGT352A3 encoded a key enzyme linked to neonicotinoid resistance. In resistant strains, UGT352A3 expression was elevated 1.8- to 6.6-fold compared to susceptible strains, which correlated with higher resistance ratios. RNAi-mediated knockdown of UGT352A3 in resistant whitefly strains significantly heightened their sensitivity to the insecticides, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid. Molecular docking analyses further confirmed a strong binding affinity between UGT352A3 and thiamethoxam and imidacloprid, which supported a role in their metabolism. These findings suggest that UGT352A3 is a critical factor in the development of resistance to thiamethoxam and imidacloprid in whitefly, underscoring its important potential as a new pest resistance management target.
40015911	Honey bees prefer moderate sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid and experience increased mortality.	Acetamiprid, a prevalent neonicotinoid residue in honey, poses long-term risks to honey bee health even at sublethal concentrations. Despite this, the chronic lethal effects across a bee's full adult life stage and the influence of acetamiprid at environmentally relevant concentrations on food preferences in honey bees remain uncertain. By conducting a long-term survival monitoring, we found that bees chronically exposed to 0.75 mg/L acetamiprid exhibited a greater mortality compared to those exposed to the highest concentration (3 mg/L) when given a choice between acetamiprid-treated syrup and nontreated pollen. Bees exposed to 0.75 mg/L acetamiprid consumed less pollen and higher amounts of treated syrups compared to the control and 3 mg/L treatment, indicating a preference for moderate sublethal concentrations. To refine our understanding, we tested a range of additionally extended acetamiprid concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 mg/L) using various food-choice assays. The findings indicated no consumption bias and revealed a significant dose-response relationship concerning reduced survival at concentrations exceeding 0.5 mg/L of acetamiprid in the no-choice assay, while manifesting a highest preference for 0.5 mg/L concentration in the two-choice and five-choice assays. This study underscores the hidden risk of acetamiprid threatening bees through foraging preferences on specific range of concentrations.
40015910	Characterization of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora response to insect-derived and non-biological stimuli: Insights into nematode recovery and released proteins.	Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are biological control agents that naturally kill insect pests, providing an eco-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms behind the recovery process, where infective juveniles (IJs) transition to a parasitic state upon contact with the host, remain unclear. This study investigates the stimulatory effect of insect-derived materials on the recovery of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora IJs. Three materials from Galleria mellonella larvae-bioactive homogenates from live and frozen larvae, and heat-inactivated homogenate-were tested, along with non-host stimuli including filtered water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). While none of the materials induced complete recovery of IJs, all triggered the release of excreted/secreted products (ESPs), with consistent protein concentrations across treatments. However, mass spectrometry revealed significant differences in ESP protein composition. IJs exposed to PBS released the highest number of proteins, while bioactive homogenates induced the fewest. Proteins linked to host-parasite interactions, such as alpha-2-macroglobulins and trypsin inhibitor-like proteins, were more abundant in ESPs following exposure to insect-derived materials and PBS. Interestingly, nematodes exposed to water released a substantial number of proteins, comparable to stimulation by heat-inactivated homogenates, though their protein profiles were distinct, reflecting stress responses in the former and host-parasite interaction-related proteins in the latter. Our findings demonstrate that both host-derived and non-biological stimuli can trigger IJs recovery and ESPs release, underscoring the complexity of host-nematode interactions. These results provide novel insights into molecular mechanisms underlying H. bacteriophora parasitism and may contribute to optimizing biocontrol strategies through a better understanding of nematode activation and released ESPs.
40015908	Exploring the role of CYP6AB328 in spinetoram resistance and growth and development of Phthorimaea absoluta.	Phthorimaea absoluta is a major agricultural pest, affecting tomatoes and other solanaceous crops. Insect cytochrome P450 is a key enzyme that metabolizes xenobiotics (insecticides and plant toxins) and regulates endogenous compounds, but the functions of specific CYP genes in P. absoluta remain unclear. This study analyzed the expression pattern of 97 CYP genes in two regional populations of P. absoluta from Xinjiang, China. CYP6AB328 was identified as the most significantly overexpressed in the strain from Yining city (YN) compared to the strain from Alaer city (Ala), its expression level exhibited a positively correlated with the accumulating resistance of spinetoram. Following the cloning and sequence analysis of the target gene, it was named CYP6AB328. Additionally, a leaflet delivery system demonstrated the relatively stable presence of dsCYP6AB328 in the leaves from 12 to 24 h. The expression level of CYP6AB328 was significantly reduced by 68.9 % in 2nd instar larvae treated with 7.5 μg/200 μL dsCYP6AB328 at 48 h. Knockdown CYP6AB328 significantly increased susceptibility to spinetoram in the SPI-S strain (belongs to YN strain) and markedly decreased the spinetoram resistance ratio in the resistant strain (SPI-R: 250.57-fold). Notably, silencing CYP6AB328 inhibited nearly all 1st instar larvae fully mining the leaves, resulting in mortality up to 95.3 %, while in 2nd instar larvae, it prolonged leaf-mining time, reduced leaf damage, extended the development time of 2nd to 4th instar, caused 18 % larval abnormality and achieved an 84.4 % mortality on the 6th day of treatment. In summary, our findings indicate that CYP6AB328 plays an important role in promoting development of spinetoram resistance and growth and development of P. absoluta.
40015907	A functional study of the trehalase genes in Tribolium castaneum and their application in the construction of RNAi engineering bacteria.	Tribolium castaneum, belonging to the order Coleoptera, family Tenebrionidae, is a global grain storage pest. The enzyme trehalase can catalyze trehalose decomposition and participate in chitin synthesis, which is of great significance in insect physiology and may be a key target for T. castaneum pest prevention and control. This study focused on T. castaneum and explored the function of its trehalase (TcTre) in test insects' growth and development process. We analyzed the roles of TcTre in different growth stages and tissues of T. castaneum by measuring its spatio and temporal expression patterns. The silencing of TcTre by RNAi technology reduced the transcription level of the target gene, affected the enzyme activity of trehalase, disturbed the sugar balance, blocked the pathway of chitin synthesis, and caused abnormal molting and wing development of the tested insects. Key genes about pest control such as TcTre1-1, TcTre1-3, and TcTre2 were screened, which caused the accumulated mortality of 53.33 %, 56.67 %, and 50.00 % respectively. Subsequently, an engineered bacterium, Tre-L4440-HT115 (DE3), was developed to efficiently express dsRNA and mediate insecticidal activity. The dsRNA produced by the bacterial solution, targeting TcTre1-1, TcTre1-3, and TcTre2 fragments for silencing, could cause the death of 44.44 %, 48.89 %, and 46.67 % of the test insects cumulatively. This advancement was aimed at reducing the production costs of dsRNA and laying a scientific foundation for the industrial development of nucleic acid pesticides for T. castaneum.
40015906	Toxicological investigations of biosynthesized nickel ferrites nanoparticles on midgut epithelium of Blaps polychresta as nanopesticides: Structural damages and oxidative stress.	The development of eco-friendly insecticides with the ability to overcome insecticide resistance remains a thorny issue. This study therefore intends to evaluate the effectiveness of green synthesized nickel ferrite nanoparticles (NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs) as nanopesticides in this first report using darkling beetles, Blaps polychresta, as a model. The biosynthesized NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs were characterized employing various approaches, including FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, and VSM. The morphological features and size of the nanoparticles were determined adopting SEM and TEM analyses, revealing that NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs have an average size of 24.59 nm with a quasi-spherical shape. The beetles treated with NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs showed their accumulation in midgut tissues, as evidenced by EDX analysis. Accumulation of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs in midgut epithelium induced surplus reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, engendering elevated MDA level linked with increased expression of MT1 and HSP70. Besides, decreased GST, SOD, and GSH activities were also reported. These findings indicate antioxidant defense systems malfunction due to failure of NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs detoxification. Beyond that, comet assay and flow cytometry analysis exhibited noticeable amplifications of DNA impairment and cellular apoptosis, respectively, in beetles treated with NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs compared to untreated beetles. Pathohistological and ultrastructure investigations showed various aberrations in beetles exposed to NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs, including rapture of midgut epithelium and necrotic signs, substantiating the biochemical findings. These findings suggest that NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs could be implemented in agricultural practices as a sustainable insecticidal candidate to manage insect pests. Further studies are required to investigate NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs interaction with environmental conditions.
40015905	A comparative study of the controllable release and insecticidal efficacy for two typical carrier methods on diamide insecticide delivery system.	Using nano/microcarriers of pesticides in sustainable pest management represents a promising strategy for enhancing pesticide efficiency while mitigating environmental harm. The reported pesticide loading methods include one-step self-assembly encapsulation and two-step absorption loading, but the controllable release and insecticidal efficacy of these two methods have been infrequently evaluated. Herein, the typical diamide insecticide cyantraniliprole (CTP) was employed as the model pesticide. A hydrogen bond-driven one-step self-assembly method and a chemical deposition method were utilized to fabricate highly dispersed polylactic acid (PLA) microspheres and calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) microspheres. The resulting CTP-loaded PLA microspheres (CTP-PLA MS) and CaCO<sub>3</sub> microspheres (CTP-CaCO<sub>3</sub> MS) both exhibited high adhesion, resistance to rain erosion, and insecticidal activity under laboratory conditions. However, the functional CTP-PLA MS demonstrated superior sustained pesticide release performance, higher pesticide loading capacity, and less application amount than that of CTP-CaCO<sub>3</sub> MS. At the same time, the acute toxicity of CTP-PLA MS exhibited slightly reduced acute toxicity to honeybees (Apis mellifera), signifying enhanced biocompatibility. Finally, the CTP-PLA MS maintained superior insecticidal efficacy than the normal CTP in controlling O. nubilalis at a low concentration. The present study represents a promising pesticide carrier as a highly efficient, eco-friendly agent for sustained management of O. nubilalis.
40015904	Re-exploration of phenolic compounds from natural waste rice husks: Combined synthesis of novel herbicide and evaluation of herbicidal activity.	In a global context, weed management has emerged as a significant challenge in agricultural production, causing substantial economic losses annually. Consequently, the development of innovative and efficient herbicides is crucial. Natural products serve as important sources for discovering novel herbicides. Through chemical synthesis and structural modification of natural compounds, novel herbicides can be developed. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO, EC 1.3.3.4) catalyzes the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX, a critical step in the biosynthesis of porphyrins. PPO inhibitors target protoporphyrinogen oxidase, inhibiting its activity and thereby blocking porphyrin biosynthesis, ultimately leading to plant death. In this research, protoporphyrinogen oxidase was targeted, and monomeric compounds were extracted from natural rice husks, followed by selective manipulation to design and synthesize 33 new compounds. Weed control assays (37.5-300 g ai/ha) showed that most of the new compounds exhibited significant herbicidal activity against dicot weeds, but less effectiveness against monocot weeds. In particular, compound I-c4 demonstrated excellent post-emergence herbicidal activity on six weed species, comparable to the commercial herbicide oxyfluorfen. Activity experiments showed that compound I-c4 significantly reduced PPO levels in weeds. Molecular docking results indicated that compound I-c4 effectively occupies the substrate pocket of PPO enzymes, demonstrating strong inhibitory effects on receptor protein activity. Thus, compound I-c4 shows promise as a novel PPO herbicide for effective weed control.
40015903	Design and synthesis of sulfur-containing pseudilin analogs and their biological activity evaluation.	Pseudilin is a natural product that inhibits the enzyme 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase (IspD) in the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, and using it as a template for designing lead structure is an effective strategy in developing new active compounds. In this work, a series of sulfur-containing pseudilin analogs were designed by replacing the pyrrole rings in pseudilin with pyrazole rings through bioisosteric replacement strategy, while introducing sulfur-containing groups. The target compounds were synthesized through a four-step reaction sequence, in which the key intermediate of sulfur-containing chromones was obtained by cyclization reaction, further transannulation, oxidation, and finally bromination. The bioactivity evaluation demonstrated that most of the synthesized compounds exhibited certain IspD enzyme inhibitory activity and good pre-emergence model plants inhibitory activity. Notably, these compounds showed stronger inhibitory effects on the monocot Echinochloa crus-galli (E. crus-galli) compared to the dicot Brassica napus L (B. napus L). In particular, compound 5h exhibited potent inhibitory activity against the Arabidopsis thaliana IspD (AtIspD) enzyme and achieved the highest pre-emergence herbicidal activity, superior to the control pentabromopseudilin (PBQ). The molecular docking results showed that compound 5h could bind well to the allosteric site of AtIspD, and the confirmed 5h and PBQ bind to the IspD in a similar way. These results suggest that the sulfur-containing compound 5h may represent a novel herbicide lead compound with new mode of action targeting IspD in the MEP pathway.
40015901	The novel Bacillus thuringiensis HSY204 as a potential bioinsecticide with efficacy against Aedes aegypti larvae.	Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), renowned for its potential, rapid action and environmental sustainability, remains an understudied group, particularly in newly identified strains. In this study, we screened a novel Bt strain, HSY204, extracted from soil samples. Our results revealed that HSY204 belonged to a new species of Bt with remarkable efficacy against Aedes aegypti larvae. The complete HSY204 genome analysis revealed nine toxin genes. In particular, a protein similar to Xpp37Aa showed very promising effectiveness in mosquito suppression, though surpassed by Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti). This research provides a valuable background for future biotechnological applications of HSY204 strain as a basis for the production of commercial bioinsecticides, thereby contributing to the development of innovative and environmentally friendly bioinsecticide strategies.
40015900	Effects of the insecticide thiodicarb on non-target organs and behavior of the stingless bee Partamona helleri (Hymenoptera: Meliponini).	Stingless bees are vital pollinators in the Neotropics and can be exposed to pesticides used in agriculture during their foraging activities. Among these pesticides, the insecticide thiodicarb is commonly applied to bean and sunflower crops, posing a potential risk to the stingless bee Partamona helleri, which pollinates these plants. This study aimed to investigate the effects of thiodicarb on mortality, morphology, programmed cell death signaling pathways in the midgut and Malpighian tubules, and the locomotion behavior of P. helleri workers. The estimated lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) of thiodicarb for P. helleri was 87 μg a.i. mL<sup>-1</sup>. Bees fed this concentration exhibited morphological damage to the midgut epithelium and Malpighian tubules, including brush border degeneration, increased cytoplasm vacuolation, and the release of cell fragments into the intestinal lumen. In the midgut, regenerative cells showed cytoplasm disorganization and nuclear pyknosis. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed an increase in cell death via autophagy and apoptosis in the epithelial cells of the affected organs. Ingestion of thiodicarb also altered the bees' locomotion, resulting in increased meandering and decreased walking speed and total distance traveled. These findings demonstrate that the LC<sub>50</sub> of thiodicarb causes damage to non-target organs as the midgut and Malpighian tubules, and impairs behavior, which may ultimately affect the pollination services provided by P. helleri. These results enhance our understanding of the vulnerability of stingless bees to insecticides and underscore the importance of strategies aimed at protecting these pollinators.
40015898	Comparative toxicity mechanisms of sulfoxaflor and lambda-cyhalothrin against Apolygus lucorum from enzymatic and transcriptomic perspectives: Efficient application of insecticides.	The pyrethroid insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin is threatened by insecticide resistance and has been registered to control Apolygus lucorum. The sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor as an excellent candidate is recommended for its management. Previous studies have mainly focused on identifying resistance genes and their sublethal effects on the biological characteristics of these two insecticides in this pest. However, the toxicity mechanism differences of lambda-cyhalothrin and sulfoxaflor exposures are largely unknown. The LD<sub>10</sub> and LD<sub>30</sub> values were measured with significant difference as 0.15, 0.46, 33.58, and 73.60 ng/insect for sulfoxaflor and lambda-cyhalothrin, respectively, indicating differences in the insecticide type. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor resulted in a higher total number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (550 and 995 DEGs) than exposure to sublethal lambda-cyhalothrin (101 and 112 DEGs). Moreover, enrichment analysis showed that more metabolic and signaling pathways were involved in the toxicity of sulfoxaflor than that of lambda-cyhalothrin, and enzyme activities in the enriched pathways were induced by sulfoxaflor and inhibited by lambda-cyhalothrin. For transcriptome validation, DEGs encoding detoxification-related genes were identified and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). These results indicate that sulfoxaflor is more toxic than lambda-cyhalothrin due to different modes of action. Our findings not only first provide insight into the toxicity mechanism differences of lambda-cyhalothrin and sulfoxaflor action and detoxification in A. lucorum at molecular and biochemical levels but also offer data and techniques for registering candidate sulfoxaflor and efficient application of insecticides in the field.
40015897	Functional characterization of an epsilon glutathione S-transferase (SfGSTe9) associated with insecticide detoxification in Spodoptera frugiperda.	The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) is a notorious insect pest of poaceae and causes severe economic damage to major cereal crop. It has evolved with different levels of insecticide resistance. Insect cytosolic GSTs are a major class of detoxifying enzymes and have been implicated in metabolic resistance and protection against oxidative stress. In this study, an epsilon class GST (SfGSTe9) was identified from S. frugiperda and its transcript levels were highest in the fat bodies, second instar and pupae. Furthermore, SfGSTe9 is upregulated after exposure to beta-cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos, and malathion. The kinetic analysis suggests the purified recombinant proteins exhibit CDNB conjugating activity, with the V<sub>max</sub> of 11.87 ± 0.25 μM·min<sup>-1</sup> ·mg<sup>-1</sup> protein and K<sub>m</sub> of 0.22 ± 0.01 mM. The peroxidase activity assays indicate that SfGSTe9 has antioxidant activity against both CHP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2.</sub> The inhibition assays infer that four types of insecticides have strong inhibition on the GST activity. In vitro metabolism assays with HPLC further suggest that SfGSTe9 could be able to deplete 11.2 %, 21.3 % and 19.3 % of beta-cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and chlorpyrifos within 2 h, respectively, with specific activity varying between 30 and 40 μM·min<sup>-1</sup> ·mg<sup>-1</sup> protein. However, no metabolites were identified in this case, indicating that SfGSTe9 probably involves in detoxification via binding and sequestration. 3D modeling and molecular docking analysis indicate that above three types of insecticide compounds fit nicely into the hydrophobic pocket in the active site of SfGSTe9. Our results definitely demonstrate that SfGSTe9 of S. frugiperda plays pivotal role in insecticide detoxification and serves in defence against oxidative stress.
40015896	Alterations in microbial community structures and metabolic function in soil treated with biological and chemical insecticides.	Entomopathogenic fungi show significant promise as effective and ecological friendly alternatives to chemical insecticides for insect pest control. However, little is known concerning their effects on soil ecosystems, especially in comparison to application of chemical insecticides. Here, we examined the effects of one biological and two chemical insecticides, Metarhizium anisopliae, imidacloprid (IMI) and emamectin benzoate (EMB) on microbial community structure, metabolic functioning, and soil biochemistry. Treatment with EMB and IMI, reduced Actinobacteriota populations, while increasing that of Acidobacteriota. However, these populations were not significantly altered under M. anisopliae treatment. Chemical pesticides also altered fungal communities including potential pathogens. Activities of soil beneficial nitrogen-cycling-related enzymes were reduced after application of IMI and EMB, but were increased after treatment with M. anisopliae. Metagenomics analysis showed that IMI treatment reduced levels of carbon and nitrogen-related metabolic pathways. However, M. anisopliae treatment increased representation of key enzymes involved in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling important for maintenance of soil fertility. Insecticides treatments altered the abundance of a number antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) but not virulence factors (VFs), whereas application of M. anisopliae resulted had only minimal effects. These findings highlight the consequences of use of biological vs. chemical pesticides on soil microbiology can affect plant and ecosystem health indicating that the fungal biological control agent, M. anisopliae likely has far less detrimental and potentially beneficial effects on soil ecology as compared to chemical pesticides.
40015895	Suppression of Adipokinetic hormones enhances Ascovirus HvAV-3h killing speed in Helicoverpa armigera.	The emergence of pesticide resistance in Helicoverpa armigera and other pests represents a challenge, necessitating continued development of innovative insecticides. Ascoviruses are a potential insecticide for H. armigera. These double-stranded DNA viruses cause cell death and lethal disease in infected larvae. However, this disease is chronic and prolongs the lifespan of the infected larvae by several weeks. The slow killing speed limits the success of these pathogens in the insecticidal market. Here, we demonstrate that the dsRNA silencing of H. armigera neuropeptide Adipokinetic Hormones (HaAKH) accelerates the killing speed of Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3h (HvAV-3h) against the third-instar larvae of H. armigera. The LT50 was reduced to 3.96 days in larvae with silenced HaAKH1 and 4.7 days in those with silenced HaAKH3. Moreover, the histopathological examinations revealed the destruction of the host's fat body and epidermal tissue shrinkage after HaAKH silencing during HvAV-3h infection. Examining detoxification and antioxidant enzyme activity in HvAV-3h infected larvae showed reduced detoxification mechanisms after HaAKH gene silencing. Furthermore, the silencing of HaAKH resulted in an overall reduction in the fold changes of proline dehydrogenase. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the ascovirus killing speed can be accelerated by interfering with the host neuropeptide-related gene expression. Moreover, the silencing of H. armigera HaAKH1 and HaAKH3 decreased the antiviral immunity against HvAV-3h.
40015894	Chronic sublethal exposure to chlorantraniliprole inhibits growth and development by disrupting the sugar and fatty acid metabolism in Spodoptera frugiperda.	Chlorantraniliprole is extensively utilized for managing lepidopteran pests, such as Spodoptera frugiperda. However, its long-lasting residual effects and extended half-life result in prolonged exposure of target insects to low dose insecticide, leading to sublethal effects. This study investigates the sublethal effects of chlorantraniliprole on the growth and development, reproductive capacity, population parameters, nutritional indicators, and sugar-lipid metabolism in S. frugiperda. The results demonstrated that sustained exposure to sublethal concentrations not only prolongs larval and pupal stages but also significantly decreases weights at each developmental phase, lowers pupation rates and markedly impairs ovarian development. Furthermore, exposure to sublethal chlorantraniliprole significantly increased approximate digestibility (AD) but decreased efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), and relative growth rate (RGR) in F<sub>0</sub>, leading to nutrient deficiencies required for proper growth, development, and metabolic detoxification, with a substantial depletion of stored energy reserves. Importantly, the finding revealed a significant decrease in energy storage compounds (glycogen, trehalose, and triglycerides) in the treated insects, accompanied by changes in enzymes and genes associated with sugar-lipid metabolism. Moreover, age-stage two-sex life table analysis revealed significant transgenerational impacts, hindering the population growth of the F<sub>1</sub> generation. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of recognizing sublethal effects when designing pest management strategies, demonstrating the efficacy of chlorantraniliprole while also highlighting the necessity of considering its potential long-term ecological consequences.
40015893	Cytoprotective effect of l-carnitine against mancozeb-induced oxidative damage in human erythrocytes.	Mancozeb is a commonly used fungicide that protects crops from numerous fungal pathogens. However, due to its widespread application, mancozeb has emerged as a significant human health hazard. Mancozeb causes oxidative damage to human cells, including erythrocytes. In this study, we have investigated the cytoprotective potential of the dietary antioxidant, l-carnitine, on mancozeb-induced oxidative damage in human erythrocytes. Incubation of erythrocytes with 100 μM mancozeb for 24 h caused a substantial elevation of markers of hemoglobin, lipid and protein oxidation. Intracellular levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were considerably increased, and the antioxidant defense system of erythrocytes was severely compromised. Several enzymes catalyzing vital metabolic processes in erythrocytes were significantly inhibited. Mancozeb damaged the plasma membrane, increasing osmotic fragility and cell lysis. Membrane damage resulted in morphological transformation of the normal biconcave erythrocytes to echinocytes and stomatocytes. Erythrocytes incubated with l-carnitine (100-750 μM) for 2 h prior to mancozeb treatment showed a marked reduction in oxidative damage. l-carnitine effectively neutralized free radicals and reactive species, thereby significantly diminishing oxidative stress. The activities of antioxidant and metabolic enzymes were also restored. Preincubation with l-carnitine stabilized the erythrocyte membrane and maintained its standard biconcave shape. Incubation of erythrocytes with l-carnitine alone did not alter any of the above parameters. Thus, l-carnitine can serve as an effective protectant against pesticide-induced cytotoxicity in human erythrocytes.
40015892	Minimal toxicological impact of chlorothalonil on adult honey bees (Apis mellifera, L.).	Honey bees encounter a diverse array of pesticides in their foraging areas and inside their colonies. Beekeepers have expressed tremendous concern about the impacts of pesticides on honey bee colony health and their beekeeping business. The fungicide chlorothalonil is frequently detected at concentrations above 5 ppm within colonies. Exposure to chlorothalonil in lab studies have shown impacts on larval development and morphology of emerging adults while field studies have shown that colony losses are associated with chlorothalonil at 5 ppm. This research was conducted to test if chlorothalonil has effects on honey bee toxicity, insecticide synergism, detoxification activity, and expression of esterase and cytochrome P450 genes in order to assess if chlorothalonil may contribute to colony losses via direct or enhanced toxicity. Exposure to 10 μg topically applied doses or 5 ppm orally applied concentrations of technical or formulated chlorothalonil did not result in significant direct mortality, demonstrated <2-fold levels of synergism or antagonism with phenothrin, chlorpyrifos, and clothianidin, and did not impact activity or expression of detoxification enzymes. Therefore, the impacts of chlorothalonil on honey bee colony health is likely not due to toxicity or synergism but rather other physiological mechanisms.
40015891	Glutathione-s-transferase regulates oxidative stress in Megalurothrips usitatus in response to environmental stress.	The escalating environmental pollution, coupled with the degradation of the ozone layer, has led to an increase in ultraviolet radiation (UV) at the Earth's surface. There is also a growing accumulation of pesticide residues in the environment. These stressors are exerting a profound impact on insect populations. When insects are subjected to adverse environmental stressors, their antioxidant enzymes can quickly respond with appropriate feedback adjustments, facilitating their adaptation to environmental changes. Glutathione S-transferases (GST), integral members of a multifunctional supergene family in insects, are pivotal in countering environmental stress and detoxifying chemical agents. Through transcriptomic screening and RT-qPCR, this investigation identified MuGSTs1 as a gene whose expression is significantly altered under UV stress. The application of RNAi confirmed the gene's function in managing oxidative stress induced by UV and lambda-cyhalothrin. The research demonstrated that Megalurothrips usitatus, the M. usitatus, adapts to these stressors by modulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes, thereby exhibiting a robust adaptability to UV light and lambda-cyhalothrin exposure. Experimental silencing of MuGSTs1 has been shown to impair the M. usitatus's oxidative stress management, resulting in accelerated cellular apoptosis and an increased susceptibility to lambda-cyhalothrin, with sensitivity being augmented by a factor of 2.89. These findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the adaptive mechanisms of insects to environmental stress.
40015890	Nematicidal activity of pyrazine compounds against Meloidogyne incongnita, Burshaphelenchus xylophilus, and Aphelenchoides besseyi.	The increase of plant parasitic nematode resistance poses a great threat to agricultural and forestry production. To search for nematicides with novel mechanism of action, nematicidal activity of the 29 pyrazine compounds were tested. Compound C2 showed excellent nematicidal activity against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, Meloidogyne incongnita, and Aphelenchoides besseyi, with LC<sub>50</sub> values were 2.3, 3.3, and 10.6 mg/L, respectively, and the pot experiment showed that C2 reduced the number of tomato roots knots to a certain extent. In addition, C2 significantly inhibited egg hatching, locomotion and reproductive ability of B. xylophilus, and also reduced the levels of protein and antioxidant enzyme activity to some extent, and the indexes related to oxidative stress showed an increasing trend after treatment. The novel chemical structure of compound D was designed and synthesized based on the lead compound C2 by the scaffold hopping strategy. Interestingly, compound D also has excellent nematicidal activity. Compound D can be used as an excellent scaffold in the discovery of novel nematicides and we will continue to work on the optimization and modification of this scaffold structure in the future.
40015889	Effects of copper-based fungicides on the growth and tolerance of Helicoverpa armigera: implications for pest management.	Heavy metal pollution, particularly from copper (Cu)-based fungicides, has emerged as a major environmental issue. The extensive and frequent use of these fungicides in agriculture, coupled with their persistent residues on plant surfaces, necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of their effects on surrounding organisms. This study specifically targets Helicoverpa armigera larvae to systematically evaluate changes in their viability and ecological fitness in response to excessive Cu<sup>2+</sup> exposure by simulating field-relevant dosages of Cu-containing fungicides. The results indicate that, at the tested doses, excessive Cu<sup>2+</sup> treatment had an insignificant impact on the developmental indices of H. armigera larvae. However, it significantly stimulated genetic expression and metabolic activity, notably enhancing the expression of trehalases and detoxification enzymes such as GST, CarE, and CYP450 across various tissues. This metabolic enhancement led to increased food intake in the larvae, thereby strengthening their tolerance to pesticides (azadirachtin, chlorfenapyr, and chlorantraniliprole) under both contact and ingestion toxicity. Moreover, the increased Cu<sup>2+</sup> exposure reduced the parasitism rate, egg-laying capacity, and host preference of parasitic wasps. Further investigation revealed that H. armigera larvae primarily expel excess Cu through fecal excretion and molting. This study underscores the importance of evaluating the broader ecological impacts of Cu-based fungicides beyond their primary use for pathogen control. The findings provide essential insights into the mechanisms underlying the resurgence of H. armigera and offer theoretical guidance for the rational integration and application of fungicides and pest management strategies.
40015888	Functional analysis of AccCPR in Apis cerana cerana under pesticide and heavy metal stress.	NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) plays important roles in the metabolism of both endogenous and exogenous compounds through cytochrome P450, and is also involved in the detoxification of insecticides mediated by cytochrome P450. However, the CPR from Apis cerana cerana has not been well characterized and its function is still undescribed. This study isolated the CPR gene from Apis cerana cerana and investigated its functional role in the resistance to pesticide and heavy metal stress. Bioinformatic analysis revealed significant homology between the gene and its counterparts in other species. Functional investigations demonstrated diverse expression and localization patterns of this gene, with AccCPR primarily expressed in muscular tissues and the gut, suggesting its potential roles in flight activities and intestinal barrier function of bees. Furthermore, the expression levels of this gene were significantly modulated under pesticide and heavy metal stress. Notably, the overexpression of AccCPR led to a marked alteration the tolerance to external stressors in E. coli. Additionally, the silencing of the AccCPR gene resulted in a significant decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity and the expression levels of genes associated with antioxidant functions. Consequently, the mortality rate of Apis cerana cerana under imidacloprid stress was significantly elevated. Taken together, our findings suggest that AccCPR may play a pivotal role in the resistance of Apis cerana cerana to abiotic stresses such as pesticides and heavy metals by regulating antioxidant pathways.
40015887	Molecular cloning and functional characterizations of transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) in Aedes albopictus.	Aedes albopictus is a potent vector of major arboviruses that cause serious health burdens and economic losses in worldwide. To facilitate the exploration of potential mosquito repellents, the Ae. albopictus TRPA1 (AalTRPA1) gene was cloned and investigated its molecular characteristics by bioinformatics techniques and the function using electrophysiological and RNAi techniques. In vitro expression and electrophysiological analysis of Xenopus oocytes showed that high temperature and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) could activate the AalTRPA1 channel. After interfering with this gene, Ae. albopictus was insensitive to temperature changes, was more easily hurt and shot down by noxious heat; it was also insensitive to catnip, and the effect of repellent was poor. We firstly identified the molecular characterization of AalTRPA1 subfamily genes and their key role in temperature and irritant perception in Ae. albopictus, and then the AalTRPA1 has the potential to develop a new mosquito repellent target against Ae. albopictus.
40015885	Insecticidal activities of essential oil from Hedychium coronarium rhizome and its mixture of compounds against the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).	The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is an insect pest that severely affects agricultural crops worldwide. This species can generally be controlled using synthetic insecticides, but these insecticides can cause several adverse effects. Therefore, many people prefer to utilize plant-based insecticides, especially plant essential oils, as alternatives for managing insect pests. The goal of this study was to examine the insecticidal effects of Hedychium coronarium rhizome essential oil (HCEO) and its major compounds against S. frugiperda. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of HCEO identified 1,8-cineole (39.54 %), β-pinene (25.44 %), α-pinene (12.55 %) and limonene (4.68 %) as the major compounds. The assessed LD<sub>50</sub> value for HCEO on S. frugiperda larvae via topical application at 24 h was 8.25 μg/larva. Among the major compounds tested, 1,8-cineole demonstrated the highest toxicity, followed by limonene, β-pinene and α-pinene, with LD<sub>50</sub> values of 12.65, 14.17, 23.97 and 29.12 μg/larva, respectively. Furthermore, all combinations of the four major compounds (1,8-cineole, β-pinene, α-pinene and limonene) exhibited synergistic insecticidal effects on S. frugiperda larvae. Additionally, HCEO and its major compounds had deleterious effects on the growth and development of S. frugiperda. The egg-hatching rate was also reduced. Moreover, S. frugiperda larvae treated with HCEO and 1,8-cineole presented a significant decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity. In summary, our findings suggest that HCEO and its major compounds have effective insecticidal activity for the control of S. frugiperda.
40015884	Differential contributions of the ryanodine receptor I4723M and I4723K mutations to diamide resistance in Spodoptera litura.	The common cutworm, Spodoptera litura, is a significant pest that damaging various crops. Previous research has shown that the I4723M mutation in the ryanodine receptor of S. litura (SlRyR), which is equivalent to the Plutella xylostella RyR I4790M, confers approximately 20-fold resistance to chlorantraniliprole. Recently, we identified a new I4723K mutation in SlRyR, in addition to I4723M, from the HZ23 population of S. litura collected in 2023 from Huizhou, Guangdong province, China. This study characterized the resistance to diamides conferred by these two point mutations of SlRyR. The HZ23 population demonstrated an 81-fold resistance to chlorantraniliprole, and the frequencies of the wild type allele 4723I and two mutant alleles 4723M and 4723K were 0.055, 0.93 and 0.015, respectively. Through marker-assisted selection, we isolated three strains from the HZ23 population, named HZ-4723I, HZ-4723M, and HZ-4723K, homozygous for each of the three alleles. Compared to the HZ-4723I strain, the HZ-4723M strain displayed medium-level resistance (23- to 43-fold), whereas the HZ-4723K strain exhibited high-level resistance (> 500-fold) to four diamides including chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, flubendiamide, and tetraniliprole. Genetic analysis revealed that resistance to chlorantraniliprole conferred by either I4723M or I4723K mutations was autosomal, incompletely recessive, and tightly linked with the SlRyR mutations. Given that the I4723K mutation confers much higher levels of diamide resistance than the I4723M mutation, the continued intensive use of diamide insecticides is likely to increase the frequency of the I4723K mutation in S. litura field populations. Our findings provide valuable insights for the monitoring and management of diamide resistance in this pest species.
40015883	Coat protein I genes are essential for the morphogenesis of the intestinal tract in Locusta migratoria.	The coat protein I (COPI) complex is crucial in several significant physiological processes in eukaryotes. The assembly of COPI vesicles is initiated by the recruitment of adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) to the membrane. Previous studies have primarily focused on the roles of COPI in yeast, humans, insects, and beyond Drosophila. However, the function of COPI during the development of insects remains largely unknown. In this study, we first identified eight COPI assembly genes, including α-, β-, β'-, γ-, δ-, ε-, ζ-COPI, and Arf1 in Locusta migratoria. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that these genes were uniformly expressed in multiple tissues, including wing pads, leg, foregut, midgut, hindgut, and gastric cecum, and on all developmental days in 5th-instar nymphs. The injection of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) against LmCOPI and LmArf1 induced high silencing efficiency in the 3rd- and 5th-instar nymphs. Locusts treated with dsLmCOPIs and dsLmArf1 exhibited feeding cessation, leading to 100 % mortality. LmCOPIs and LmArf1 knockdown resulted in midgut and gastric cecum atrophy. Histological observation and hematoxylin-eosin staining indicated that the midgut and gastric cecum exhibited deformed structures, with defective microvilli and midgut peritrophic matrix. These results suggest that LmCOPIs and LmArf1 significantly affect the intestinal tract morphogenesis in locust nymphs. Thus, COPI assembly genes are promising RNA interference targets for managing L. migratoria, reducing the dependence on chemical pesticides for pest control.
40015881	Widespread resistance of the apple aphid Aphis spiraecola to pyrethroids in China.	The apple aphid, Aphis spiraecola, is an important pest in apple orchards. Pyrethroids had been widely used for the control of apple aphid. To verify the resistance level of A. spiraecola against pyrethroid insecticides, 35 field populations from main apple-producing areas of China were collected, and the susceptibility to type I and type II pyrethroids were assessed. Bioassays showed that six populations were highly resistant to bifenthrin (RR = 40.97-93.88 fold), and 12 populations showed the extremely high resistance against permethrin (RR = 161.17-349.27-fold). Moreover, all field populations developed high to extremely high resistance against lambda-cyhalothrin, fenvalerate and deltamethrin, except the HNLY and SXYL populations. Toxicity assays indicated that A. spiraecola field populations have developed serious resistance to multiple pyrethroids, and the relative highest resistance occurred in SXQX population. Pre-exposure to different synergists did not significantly increased the toxicity of pyrethroids to SXQX population, indicating a minor role of metabolic resistance in the resistant A. spiraecola. Sequencing of voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) genes revealed two homozygous mutations (918V/V and 1014F/F) and six heterozygous mutations (918M/V, 1014L/F, 918M/V+1014L/F, 918V/V+1014L/F, 918M/V+1014F/F and 918M/L+1014L/F) in A. spiraecola. Moreover, 1014L/F and 918M/V+1014L/F mutations were the dominant genotypes with frequencies of 26.67 % and 33.33 % in field populations, respectively. These results indicate that A. spiraecola in China has developed resistance against pyrethroids, and the resistance are mainly caused by mutations in VGSC. Pyrethroid insecticides should not be employed in these fields-evolved resistance, where the practical resistance management is urgently needed.
40015880	New insight into Poa annua control with clethodim from the dose-response study using several grass species and ACCase gene expression study.	Poa annua L., a widespread allotetraploid weed, possesses both Leu<sub>1781</sub>-resistant and Ile<sub>1781</sub>-susceptible ACCase genes. This study aimed to elucidate how P. annua is controlled by the ACCase inhibitor clethodim, despite its resistance to many other ACCase-inhibiting herbicides. We conducted whole-plant and enzyme-level dose-response assays on P. annua, resistant fescue species (Festuca rubra and F. brevipila) with only Leu<sub>1781</sub>-resistant ACCase, and susceptible species (Poa pratensis and Lolium multiflorum) with only Ile<sub>1781</sub>-susceptible ACCase. We also investigated the expression ratio of the two ACCase genes in P. annua. The enzyme assay revealed that P. annua's resistance was intermediate between susceptible and resistant species, with a double-sigmoid dose-response curve indicating a functional 50:50 ratio of resistant and susceptible enzymes, i.e., the activity of the susceptible enzyme dilutes that of the resistant enzyme, leading to reduced resistance (the so-called dilution effect). This ratio aligns with the gene expression levels. At the whole-plant level, clethodim was effective against P. annua, but not effective against two fine fescue species at the standard dose. P. annua's dose response fell between that of susceptible and resistant species, though leaning closer to the resistant fescues. Considering the enzyme assay results, the dilution effect may also be involved at the whole-plant level. In any case, the registered dose of clethodim can be redefined as the one controlling P. annua, being set close to its ED<sub>90</sub> and located within the narrow margin of dose-response difference between the two grass groups.
40015877	Exploring mechanisms of resistance to fludioxonil in Colletotrichum fructicola.	Colletotrichum fructicola is one of the most important species causing peach anthracnose around the world, including China. Fludioxonil has been effectively applied to control anthracnose disease as well as several important fungal diseases such as gray mold, leaf blight, early blight, corn stem rot, peanut root rot, rice evil seedling disease, and other diseases transmitted through seeds or soil. In this study, 39C. fructicola isolates were collected from different locations in Guizhou Province and Guangdong Province. A sensitive isolate of C. fructicola, previously thought to be naturally resistant to fludioxonil, was unexpectedly detected. No cross-resistance was found for fludioxonil with procymidone, prochloraz, and pyraclostrobin. Significant differences were observed between sensitive and resistant isolates in terms of mycelial growth rate and osmotic sensitivity experiments (4 %, 6 %, and 8 % NaCl), but no significant difference was found for sporulation. A novel mutation I880V was detected in the Os1 protein from one sensitive isolate. Molecular docking was used to explain the reversal of inherent resistance to sensitivity of C. fructicola to fludioxonil. Results showed that the wild type Os1 protein was docked against fludioxonil with a binding energy of -6.8 kj/mol, while it increased to -6.6 kj/mol between the mutated protein and fludioxonil. At the same time, different interactions were observed between wild type and mutated proteins with fludioxonil. These results suggest that the I880V mutation in the Os1 protein changed the conformation of the binding pocket, potentially leading to the reversal from resistance to sensitivity to fludioxonil. These findings are remarkable in demonstrating the fludioxonil resistance mechanism, and further studies such as genetic transformation and a range of molecular investigations are necessary to validate resistance mechanisms, elucidate the molecular pathways involved, and develop effective disease management strategies.
40015876	Antifungal activity and active compound identification of Myrothecium spp. against grape anthracnose and gray mold.	Grape anthracnose and gray mold, caused by Elsinoë ampelina and Botrytis cinerea, are devastating fungal diseases resulting in remarkable loss to grapevine production. In this study, the biological control potential of three strains of Myrothecium spp. against E. ampelina and B. cinerea was investigated. The hypha and culture filtrate of Myrothecium spp. exhibited an antifungal activity against E. ampelina. M. cinctum, M. roridum, and Albifimbria verrucaria exhibited biocontrol efficacy of 62.82 %, 80.26 %, and 89.58 % for grape anthracnose in V. vinifera 'Thompson seedless' leaves at 6 days post-inoculation (dpi), respectively. Furthermore, A. verrucaria significantly reduced the disease index of gray mold by 41.56 % and 49.38 % in V. vinifera 'Thompson seedless' leaves at 4 dpi. The relative biomass of B. cinerea was significantly decreased after treatment with culture filtrate of A. verrucaria in berries at 2 and 4 dpi. Combining the inhibition assay of the conidial germination of B. cinerea, the active compounds of A. verrucaria were purified using column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. One active compound was identified as verrucarin A by nuclear magnetic resonance. Verrucarin A remarkably inhibited the mycelial growth of E. ampelina, Botrytis cinerea, and Coniella vitis at concentrations of 20 μg/mL. The disease incidence of gray mold was significantly reduced by 10.49 % in V. vinifera 'Red Globe' berries after treatment with verrucarin A at 5 dpi compared with control, and the biocontrol efficacy reached 66.22 %. This study demonstrates that Myrothecium spp. could be developed as an effective biocontrol agent against grape anthracnose and gray mold.
40015875	Effects of tebuconazole on insecticidal activity and symbionts in brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	Harnessing symbionts as targets for pest management is an emerging and promising strategy that can contribute to sustainable agriculture and environmental protection. Brown planthopper (BPH), a major rice pest, significantly threatens crop yields and quality. In this study, we discovered that BPHs exhibited a significant increase in mortality after consuming the fungicide tebuconazole, indicating its direct toxic effect. Tebuconazole negatively impacts the body weight, digestive enzyme activity, and reproductive capacity in BPHs, and it also leads to a significant downregulation of the expression levels of the ecdysteroid biosynthetic genes. The number of symbionts and the expression level of Noda in the BPH treated with tebuconazole was significantly reduced. Sequencing results showed that tebuconazole had a significant effect on the richness of symbiotic fungi and bacteria in BPH. As a fungicide, tebuconazole can offer new approaches and insights for managing resistance and integrated pest control.
40015874	Identification of an α-galactosidase with high affinity and synergistic activity against Bacillus thuringiensis App6Aa2 toxin in Bursaphelenchus xylophilus.	The App6Aa2 toxin, derived from Bacillus thuringiensis, is nematicidal and highly toxic to Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Receptors play a critical role in the mechanism of B. thuringiensis crystal toxin toxicity, yet the specific binding receptors for App6Aa2 in B. xylophilus have not been identified. This study identified a GPI-anchored protein, α-galactosidase (BxGal), in B. xylophilus as a potential binding protein. Western blotting and ELISA assays confirmed a high binding affinity between BxGal and App6Aa2 (Kd = 24.5 ± 11.2 nM). Remarkably, combining App6Aa2 with the BxGal protein produced a synergistic effect, significantly increasing nematode mortality from 25 % to 81 % (P < 0.05), thereby enhancing the toxicity of App6Aa2 against B. xylophilus. Besides, RNAi silencing of BxGal in nematodes had no specific effect on App6Aa2 toxicity at high concentrations, while mortality increased slightly at lower concentrations. These findings indicate that BxGal is a high-affinity binding protein for App6Aa2; it does not function as the primary receptor and warrants further investigation into its role in modulating nematode susceptibility to App6Aa2.
40015873	Involvement of AhR/ARNT in tolerance to deltamethrin by regulating the expression of TcGSTs6 in Tribolium castaneum.	It is well known that the transcription factors aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) play important roles in the detoxification of xenobiotic compounds including insecticides. In this study, TcAhR and TcARNT were cloned from Tribolium castaneum. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that TcAhR and TcARNT were highly expressed in brain and epidermis of female adults and upregulated after exposure of the adults to deltamethrin. Knockdown of TcAhR and TcARNT increased the susceptibility of T. castaneum to deltamethrin and decreased the enzymatic activity of Glutathione S-transferase (GST). Consistently, knockdown of TcAhR and TcARNT led to the downregulation of TcGSTs6 and suppressed the induction of TcGSTs6 by deltamethrin treatment. Increased susceptibility of T. castaneum to deltamethrin was also observed after knockdown of TcGSTs6. Further dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that co-overexpression of TcAhR and TcARNT in Sf9 cells significantly enhanced the promoter activity of TcGSTs6. These results provided insights into the function of insect AhR and ARNT as well as the regulatory mechanisms of insect GSTs.
40015872	An in-depth analysis of the effects of excessive acetochlor exposure on chicken liver health.	Acetochlor, a commonly used herbicide, poses significant risks to ecosystem and organism health through contamination of the food chain. Despite its widespread use, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on its toxicological effects on avian species. This study investigates the impact of environmental acetochlor exposure on chicken liver health using metabolomics analysis and histopathological techniques. Microscopic examination revealed autophagy-like structures and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) expansion, with significant effects observed at higher exposure levels. Biochemical analysis and metabolomics also demonstrated acetochlor-induced ferroptosis, highlighting disruptions in liver function. Further, in vitro studies revealed that acetochlor stimulates autophagy, which regulates ferroptosis via ferritin degradation, mediated through the ER-CaMKII pathway. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in acetochlor toxicity, particularly the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaMKII pathway, ER stress, and autophagy in ferroptosis. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of how environmental contaminants affect avian species, providing critical insights for better herbicide risk assessment, pollution control, and sustainable agricultural practices.
40015871	Peptide neurotoxins affecting insect voltage-gated calcium channels and possessing insecticidal toxicity: Two ω-Atypitoxins from Calommata signata.	Spider peptide toxins, as potent insecticides, distinguish them from current insecticides, and thus expand the range of viable molecular targets of insecticides in insect pests. This study reports the isolation of two neurotoxic peptides, ω-Atyptoxin-Cs2a (Cs2a) and ω-Atyptoxin-Cs2b (Cs2b), from the venom gland of the burrowing spider Calommata signata. These peptides exhibit strong insecticidal activity against two insect pests with agricultural importance, Nilaparvata lugens and Spodoptera frugiperda. Both toxins demonstrated rapid and significant lethality, with LD<sub>50</sub> values of 1.083 ± 0.120 nmol/g and 0.949 ± 0.079 nmol/g for N. lugens and 1.035 ± 0.114 nmol/g and 0.998 ± 0.081 nmol/g for S. frugiperda within 24 h. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, Cs2a and Cs2b were identified as inhibitors of high-voltage-activated calcium channels in cockroach DUM neurons, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.504 ± 0.078 μM and 0.411 ± 0.053 μM, respectively. These findings show that Cs2a and Cs2b are effective calcium channel blockers with potential to develop bioinsecticides, offering selective toxicity toward insect pests.
40015870	Insecticidal activity of two Pelargonium essential oils and head transcriptome analysis of stored-product pest Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) in response to citronellyl formate fumigation.	Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) is one of the most common stored-product pests, causing enormous economic losses and developing widespread resistance to chemical insecticides. Natural products derived from essential oils (EOs) are well-known for insecticidal activity against agricultural pests, especially in the management of stored-product pests. In this study, the chemical constituents and repellent, contact and fumigation toxicity activities of two Pelargonium EOs against T. castaneum were evaluated. Moreover, the fumigation mechanism of citronellyl formate was assessed by head transcriptome sequencing and RNA interference (RNAi). A total of 28 and 39 compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, accounting for 98.58 and 97.33 % of P. roseum and P. asperum EOs, and the major components were citronellol, (1S)-(1)-β-pinene and citronellyl formate. (1S)-(1)-β-Pinene exhibited strong contact toxicity activity (LD<sub>50</sub> = 19.72 μg/adult), while citronellyl formate exhibited strong repellent and fumigation toxicity activities, with the LC<sub>50</sub> value of 11.93 mg/L air. Under the stress of citronellyl formate, 1222 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 554 up-regulated and 668 down-regulated genes, which was further verified by qRT-PCR. Among odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), only TcGOBP70 was up-regulated, suggesting that GOBP70 is more likely to be involved in the defense of T. castaneum by recognizing, binding and transporting citronellyl formate. Additionally, RNAi against TcGOBP70 dramatically increased the contact and fumigation toxicity activities of citronellyl formate, with mortality rates of 73 and 75 %, respectively. Therefore, our findings not only provided theoretical bases for the comprehensive utilization of the Pelargonium species but also established potential targets for controlling T. castaneum adults.
40015867	Phytochemicals in pomegranate peel extract attenuate oxidative damage in rats exposed to fipronil.	Fipronil (FPN), a pesticide frequently used in veterinary medicine and agriculture, has been linked to adverse health consequences in non-target creatures. This study was conducted to determine the phytochemical and vitamin content of pomegranate peel ethanolic extract (PPE) and to assess its hepatoprotective impact in rats exposed to FPN insecticide. The phytochemicals were tested using LC-MS/MS, whilst the vitamins were evaluated using HPLC. Six groups of male albino rats were treated for three months, including the control group and those treated with PPE (400 mg/kg b.w.), FPN at low dosage (16.16 mg/kg b.w.), or high dose (48.5 mg/kg b.w.) alone or in combination with PPE. Blood and tissue samples were taken for various hematological, biochemical, and histopathological analyses. HPLC results revealed that PPE contains water and oil-soluble vitamins; also, LC-MS/MS identified 21 chemicals belonging to tannins, steroids, tannins, flavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, terpenoids, and saponins. The biological study revealed that FPN caused dose-dependent changes in RBCs, WBCs, MCHC, PLT count, MCH, MCV, Hb, HCT, ALT, AST, ALP, Alb, TP, urea, uric acid, creatinine, Cho, Tri G, HDL, LDL, CAT, SOD, MDA, GST, testosterone levels, and histological changes in liver and kidney. PPE administration did not show any significant changes in all the tested parameters. Co-administration with FPN and PPE induced a significant improvement in all the tested parameters towards the control levels, owing to its strong antioxidant activity. Consequently, PPE should be considered a dietary supplement in areas with high levels of FPN exposure.
40015865	N-acetylglucosamine sensor, Ngs1 contributes to Beauveria bassiana vegetative growth, oxidative phosphorylation, fungal development, and cell wall integrity during entomopathogen-insect interaction.	N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a key component of fungal cell walls and insect cuticles, is an important signal to activate fungal response during entomopathogen-insect interactions. Research on Ngs1, the only identified GlcNAc sensor and transducer, has been primarily restricted to Candida species. Although our previous work identified an Ngs1 homology in Beauveria bassiana, its physiological functions in entomopathogenic fungi remain largely unexplored. In this study, we unveiled the sub-localization of Ngs1 in the nucleolus. Further transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ngs1 plays a crucial role in vegetative growth, fungal development, and cell-wall construction by acting as a transcriptional mediator, particularly influencing carbon metabolism in response to insect cuticle stimulation. The absence of Ngs1 compromised vegetative growth across various carbon sources by downregulating expressions of key catalytic enzymes. Conversely, Ngs1 deficiency enhanced transcription levels of oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Despite higher ATP levels, Ngs1-deletion mutants exhibited reduced asexual development and hyphal germination, primarily due to the function of Ngs1 in the central developmental pathway and Brg1/Nrg1-dependent pathway. Additionally, the downregulation of N-glycan biosynthesis in ΔNgs1 diminished cell wall components, resulting in decreased cell wall resistance to lysis and impaired fungal development. These findings advance our understanding of the regulatory role of Ngs1 in B. bassiana during host interactions and provide a theoretical foundation for engineering fungi to maintain or even enhance pesticidal activity.
40015864	Cytochrome P450 CYP6EM1 confers resistance to thiamethoxam in the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) via detoxification metabolism.	The whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Gennadius) is a notorious and highly polyphagous agricultural pest that is well known for its ability to transmit a wide range of serious plant pathogenic viruses. The field populations of B. tabaci in some areas have developed resistance to thiamethoxam. We found that high expression of CYP6EM1 can enhance the resistance of B. tabaci to dinotefuran. It is unclear whether CYP6EM1 is involved in the resistance of B. tabaci to the same neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam. The results of the present study demonstrated that the expression of CYP6EM1 could be induced within 9 h after the exposure of B. tabaci adults to thiamethoxam. Molecular docking analyses, with a binding energy of -6.13 cal/mol, revealed a strong binding affinity between thiamethoxam and the CYP6EM1 protein, implying that CYP6EM1 may be involved in thiamethoxam resistance. Compared with that in the susceptible strain, the mRNA expression level of the CYP6EM1 gene was significantly greater in thiamethoxam-resistant strains (R<sup>#1</sup>, 9.93-fold, P = 0.0008; R<sup>#2</sup>, 40.43-fold, P = 0.0013; R<sup>#3</sup>, 27.40-fold, P = 0.0002; R<sup>#4</sup>, 21.63-fold, P = 0.0003 and R<sup>#5</sup>, 28.65-fold, P = 0.0006). Loss and gain of function studies in vivo were performed via RNA interference and transgenic expression in Drosophila melanogaster, and the results confirmed the role of CYP6EM1 in conferring such resistance. An in vitro metabolism assay revealed that CYP6EM1 directly metabolized 15.60 % of thiamethoxam. This study provides solid evidence for the critical role of CYP6EM1 in the metabolism of thiamethoxam, which contributes to resistance. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying neonicotinoid resistance and contributes valuable insights for the sustainable management of global pests such as whiteflies.
40015863	The diverse enzymatic targets of the essential oils of Ilex purpurea and Cymbopogon martini and the major components potentially mitigated the resistance development in tick Haemaphysalis longicornis.	The long-term use of chemical acaricides not only pollutes the environment, but also easily causes tick resistance. Plant essential oils, a kind of secondary metabolites in plants, are an important way to develop new modern pesticides. The study analyzed the acaricidal activity and molecular mechanisms of Ilex purpurea EO and Cymbopogon martini EO on Haemaphysalis longicornis (Acari: Ixodidae) unfed ticks. The chemical analysis (GC-MS) identified 7 components in I. purpurea EO and 4 in C. martini EO. The effects of the oils on unfed larvae of H. longicornis were assessed by larval packet test. The results revealed that I. purpurea EO and C. martini EO had significant toxicity against the unfed larvae. The present work evaluated the toxicity of EOs and methyl salicylate against unfed nymphs and adults of H. longicornis by immersion test. The results showed that I. purpurea EO, C. martini EO and methyl salicylate had significant toxicity against the unfed nymphs and adults. Enzyme assays showed that the oils and methyl salicylate significantly inhibited AChE and CarE activity, I. purpurea EO significantly inhibited CAT activity. These results revealed that the diverse enzymatic targets of I. purpurea EO, C. martini EO and the major components of I. purpurea potentially mitigated the resistance development in tick H. longicornis. This study revealed the mechanisms of action of I. purpurea EO and C. martini EO in nature and biotechnology. These results will open new directions for understanding how EOs interfere with tick biological systems and has broad implications for the field of acaricide design.
40015862	In-depth physiological study on the sustainable application of a botanical insecticide with low mammalian toxicity against Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae).	Research into the exploration of bioactive insecticides as an alternative to synthetic compounds has garnered increasing attention, particularly in the context of sustainable pest management. In this study, a two-sex life table was constructed based on the Waco strain to determine whether the prolonged larval period in haedoxan A-resistant (HAR) strain Aedes aegypti is related to ecdysone-regulated development. The effect of ecdysone on the sensitivity of the 3rd-instar larvae to HA was investigated, along with the determination of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) content in A. aegypti. The results showed that the 20E content in larvae from HAR strain was significantly lower than that of Waco strain. And, the sensitivity of larvae treated with ecdysone to HA was increased. Two-sex life table results indicated that ecdysone can accelerate the growth and development of larvae, however, it also shortened the life span of adult mosquitoes and reduced reproduction rate. Notably, cytotoxic activity against human normal liver cell L02 demonstrated that HA was less toxic and did not cause intracellular oxidative stress compared to permethrin. Overall, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which the larval period of A. aegypti is prolonged under HA selection. Furthermore, our results provide valuable insights for the application of HA as an effective botanical insecticide.
40015861	Influence of triflumezopyrim and triadimefon co-exposure on enzymatic activity and gene expression changes in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.).	Pollination insects frequently encounter complex mixtures of pesticides within agricultural ecosystems. However, current risk assessments for pesticides focus primarily on single agents, failing to reflect real-world conditions. Mesoionic insecticide triflumezopyrim (TFM) and triazole fungicide triadimefon (TAD) are two compounds often detected together in the environment, raising concerns over their combined toxic effects on pollinators. In this context, our study aimed to explore the enzymatic and transcriptional responses in the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) when exposed to a mixture of TFM and TAD. Our findings revealed that co-exposure to these two pesticides induced acute synergistic toxicity in A. mellifera. Furthermore, significant alterations were observed in the levels of MDA, AChE, GST, and trypsin, along with the expression of four genes (abaecin, CRBXase, CYP6AS14, and CYP306A1) linked to oxidative stress, neural function, detoxification pathways, digestion, and immune competence. Additionally, both pesticides were found to modify the molecular conformation of CAT and AChE, thereby influencing their enzymatic activities. These results underscored the biochemical and molecular toxicities resulting from the combined action of TFM and TAD on A. mellifera, offering critical insights into the ecological impact of pesticide mixtures on pollinators. Importantly, the co-presence of TFM and TAD might exacerbate physiological damage in A. mellifera, likely due to their interactive effects. Collectively, this study represented a substantial advancement in comprehending the toxicological impacts of commonly used agricultural pesticides and provided valuable foundations for developing effective strategies to mitigate their harmful effects on pollination insects.
40015860	Regulation of chitin synthesis by the juvenile hormone analogue fenoxycarb in Hyphantria cunea.	Fenoxycarb, a non-terpenoid carbamate with stomach and contact toxicity, is a promising insecticide affecting insect growth and development. However, fenoxycarb how to regulate insect digestion and absorption and chitin synthesis remains largely unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of fenoxycarb on growth, chitin synthesis, carbohydrate homeostasis, and digestive capabilities in Hyphantria cunea, a widespread agricultural and forestry pest, to clarify the action mechanism of fenoxycarb from the perspective of digestive function and carbohydrate metabolism, and confirmed that fenoxycarb significantly decreased chitin content, increased chitinase activity, and regulated the expression of genes related to chitin synthesis and degradation. Further studies showed that fenoxycarb significantly reduced glycogen content and increased glucose and trehalose contents, increased trehalase activity, and down-regulated trehalase synthesis and degradation related genes in the larvae, indicating abnormal metabolism of chitin synthesis substrates. Moreover, from the perspective of midgut digestive function, fenoxycarb significantly affected the activities of digestive enzymes in the midgut of the larvae, indicating that the larvae had digestive and absorption disorders. The findings provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which fenoxycarb abnormally promotes digestive enzyme activity in the midgut and eventually interferes with insect chitin synthesis.
40015859	Evaluation of thiobencarb herbicide-induced cytotoxicity mediated via disruption of calcium homeostasis in bovine mammary glands: A comprehensive in vitro and in silico study.	In contemporary agriculture, the predominant strategy for managing perennial weeds within agroecosystems involves the extensive use of herbicides. Thiobencarb is widely employed to control gramineous weeds during rice cultivation. This herbicide is commonly found in terrestrial environments and agricultural products. The harmful potential of thiobencarb has been reported, along with its adverse effects in exposed species. However, few studies have explored thiobencarb toxicity, specifically in dairy cows, despite the possibility of ingestion through soil residues. Exposure to xenobiotics can reduce the viability or impair the function of bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs), leading to compromised immune function and reduced milk production. Despite the known cytotoxicity of thiobencarb, its specific effects on BMECs remain unclear. Herein, we aimed to investigate the effect of thiobencarb on milk production by examining its toxic effects and underlying mechanisms in BMECs. We assessed the cytotoxic effects of thiobencarb and analyzed various cellular responses upon exposure. Thiobencarb-induced apoptosis was associated with disrupted calcium homeostasis. Additionally, thiobencarb modulated AKT/MAPK proteins and increased mRNA levels of genes related to the inflammatory response. Furthermore, treatment of BMECs with thiobencarb suppressed the expression of genes related to milk production, including those encoding superoxide dismutase, tight junctions, and casein. Finally, we conducted an in silico molecular docking analysis to evaluate the binding affinity between thiobencarb and target proteins.
40015858	Confirmation and characterisation of ALS inhibitor resistant Poa trivialis from Ireland.	Relying on one broad-spectrum product to control grass weeds has resulted in cases of resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors in species that were not the primary target such as Poa trivialis (POATR), in wheat fields in Ireland. In this study, we have characterised ALS inhibitor resistance in two populations of POATR-R, suspected of being resistant, to (i) sulfonylurea (SUs)-mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron (the selecting agent), (ii) SU + sulfonylamino‑carbonyl-triazolinone (SCT)-mesosulfuron + propoxycarbazone, and (iii) triazolopyrimidine (TP)-pyroxsulam ALS chemistries. Resistant POATR-R populations showed ALS inhibitor cross-resistance associated with target-site resistance (TSR) mutations. Combined mutations (Pro-197 and Trp-574) were found in POATR-R plants; Trp-574-Leu in POATR-R1 conferring greater SUs, SU + SCT and TP (resistance index, RI >214) resistance, while Pro-197-Thr in POATR-R2 (RI >37) was associated with less resistance. The high levels of ALS inhibitor cross-resistance in POATR-R populations caused by TSR mutations are consistent with the ploidy status, as cytogenetic tests revealed that both the R and S populations were diploid (2n = 2× = 14). Cytochrome P450 inhibitor assays did not detect metabolism-based ALS resistance in POATR-R. Alternative herbicide modes of action, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (pinoxaden, fenoxaprop, propaquizafop, cycloxydim or clethodim) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (glyphosate) inhibitors applied at the recommended label rate were highly effective on these resistant populations. Residual herbicides and cultural methods, as well as the judicious use of alternative in-crop herbicide options, should be prioritized as sustainable options for managing these ALS-resistant populations. This is first worldwide characterisation of resistance mechanisms in P. trivialis to ALS inhibitor chemistries.
40015857	Discovery of 7-hydroxy-3-(1'-methylbenzimidazol-2'-yl) coumarin as novel mitochondrial complex Ι inhibitor against Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Acari: Tetranychidae) via structure-based virtual screening.	Mitochondrial complex Ι is not only an important enzyme for ATP synthesis but also a promising target for acaricide discovery. However, in recent years, the complex Ι inhibitors with new scaffolds have been fewer reported. In this study, the full-length cDNA of subuits 49 kDa and PSST genes of complex Ι from Tetranychus cinnabarinus were cloned and characterized. Then, we integrated structure-based virtual screening, synthesis and acaricidal activity evaluation to discover complex Ι inhibitors with novel chemotypes. The results showed that the 49 kDa and PSST cDNA sequence of T. cinnabarinus consisted of 1443 bp and 687 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 480, 228 amino acids residues (GenBank accession number MZ172703 and MZ172704), and the highest relative expression of these two genes were nymphs and adults, respectively. The compound ZINC00042996 [7-hydroxy-3-(1'-methylbenzimidazol-2'-yl) coumarin] with highest acaricidal activity was obtained through virtual screening, its LC<sub>50</sub> value was 84.85 mg/L, which was in the same order of magnitude as the LC<sub>50</sub> value of pyridaben, and its control effect also could be comparable to that of the commercial acaricide pyridaben at 120 mg/L. The compound ZINC00042996 also exhibited excellent complex Ι inhibitory activity, the maximum inhibition rate was 47.03% for LC<sub>70</sub> concentration after 48 h treatment. Knocking down the 49 kDa and PSST genes increased the sensitivity of T. cinnabarinus to compound ZINC00042996. Mortality of compound ZINC00042996 significantly increased to 29.49% and 16.47% in the mites fed with 49 kDa and PSST dsRNA compared with mites treated with DEPC-water. This study laid the foundation for the development of novel acaricides targeting mitochondrial complex Ι.
40015856	Chemosensory protein 8 confers thiamethoxam resistance in Diaphorina citri.	The Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) serves as the primary vector of the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), which is responsible for causing citrus Huanglongbing. Neonicotinoid pesticides such as thiamethoxam are frequently utilized for D. citri management worldwide, but their use have resulted in considerable development of insecticide resistance within D. citri populations. Recent reports have revealed that chemosensory proteins (CSPs)-mediated resistance represents a novel insecticide resistance mechanism in insects. In this finding, we found that exposure to thiamethoxam at different concentrations resulted in significant upregulation of transcriptional levels of DcitCSP8 by 2.41, 2.24 and 1.74-fold respectively. The expression profiles among different tissues showed that DcitCSP8 highly occurred in the legs and wings, and its expression being significantly induced by thiamethoxam with 2.40-fold increase specifically in the legs. The purified recombinant protein DcitCSP8, derived from Escherichia coli expression, present strong in vitro binding affinity (Ki = 4.74 μM) to thiamethoxam. Furthermore, the nanocarrier star polycation (SPc) was used to enhance silencing efficiency, resulting in a significant reduction of DcitCSP8 by 85.37% and 91.80% at 24 and 48 h post application of SPc + ds DcitCSP8. Knockdown of DcitCSP8 transcription significantly increased the susceptibility of D. citri adults in response to thiamethoxam, while reinjection of DcitCSP8 protein could restore the resistance in DcitCSP8-silenced individuals. Our findings highlight the association between DcitCSP8 and thiamethoxam resistance via high binding affinity that mitigates toxicity in D. citri, shedding light on CSP-mediated insecticide resistance and potentially contributing to the development of novel strategies targeting CSPs for managing resistance in D. citri.
40015855	Effects of Pro197 resistance mutations occurring in different acetolactate synthase (ALS) isozymes on Descurainia sophia L. resistance to tribenuron-methyl.	Descurainia sophia L. is one of the most problematic broad-leaf weed infesting winter wheat in China, and have evolved resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicide of tribenuron-methyl. At least four ALS isozymes (ALS1 ∼ ALS4) exist in D. sophia, but these four ALS isozymes are not present in all D. sophia. In addition, amino acid mutations in ALS are mainly responsible for D. sophia resistance to tribenuron-methyl. In this study, D. sophia populations carrying homozygous mutation of Pro197Ser/Thr/Leu/Ala/His in ALS1 or in ALS2 were purified, respectively. Resistant D. sophia populations carrying mutant ALS exhibited 17 ∼ 694 folds resistance to tribenuorn-methyl. In addition, tribenuron-methyl resistance in D. sophia carrying ALS1 mutation was about 2.3 ∼ 11.4 folds higher than D. sophia with the same mutation in ALS2. The reduced binding affinity of ALS to tribenuron-methyl was mainly responsible for D. sophia resistance to tribenuron-methyl. However, the increase in resistance of D. sophia was not linear with the decrease of binding affinity of ALS to tribenuron-methyl. These results indicate that the effects of resistance mutations on ALS1 and ALS2 isozymes are not the same, and the ALS1 and ALS2 function differently in resistance evolution of D. sophia to tribenuron-methyl.
40015854	Developmental effects of fenpropathrin on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo-larvae: Toxic endpoints and potential mechanism.	Fenpropathrin (FEN), a highly efficient and broad-spectrum synthetic pyrethroid insecticide. Although sufficient concern has been given to the negative impacts of FEN on non-target organisms, limited knowledge exists regarding the developmental effects of FEN. In this study, effects of FEN (0.45, 1.35, 4.05, and 12.15 μg/L) on various early life-stage endpoints of zebrafish were investigated from 3 to 144 h post-fertilization (hpf) in order to disclose the developmental effects and underlying mechanisms caused by FEN. The results indicate that exposure to FEN induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish, including decreased heart rate, reduced blood flow, shorter body length, smaller eye size, non-inflated swim bladder, and disrupted craniofacial chondrogenesis, which were possibly due to a significant decrease in the levels of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and growth hormone (GH), increase in lipid accumulation, and alteration in the contents of total cholesterol (T-CHO) and triglyceride (TG) in larvae exposed to FEN. Besides, FEN exposure also resulted in the inhibition of spontaneous movement of embryo at 24 hpf, a decline in touch evoke response (TER) at 72 hpf, and a reduction in free-swimming activity at 144 hpf, as well as the larval activity at 144 hpf during the dark-light transition stimulus. Mechanistic examinations have shown that FEN treatment inhibits the activities of AChE and elevates the ACh levels. In addition, FEN exposure increased ROS levels and altered the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and induced apoptosis as determined by acridine orange staining and elevated caspase-3 levels, suggesting that the involvement of oxidative stress and apoptosis in FEN-induced developmental toxicity of embryos. Transcriptome sequencing of larvae showed that FEN altered the expressions of multiple metabolic and nervous system pathways, including PPAR signaling pathway, lipid metabolism pathway, carbohydrate metabolism pathway, retinol metabolism pathway, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, demonstrating that FEN alters the normal development of zebrafish embryos, and multiple pathways mediating the FEN-induced developmental toxicity. Overall, these findings enhance our understanding of the developmental toxic effects of FEN and provide fundamental data for assessing the risk of FEN on non-target organisms.
40015853	A UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene UGT379A1 involved in detoxification of lufenuron in Diaphorina citri.	The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), is a devastating bacterial disease of commercial citrus. Presently, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), have been linked to the detoxification of pesticides, were known as phase II enzymes in the detoxification process. However, the role of UGTs in detoxification of lufenuron in Diaphorina citri is unknown. In this study, we identified a UGT gene, UGT379A1, which was significantly up-regulated under the exposure of lufenuron. The knockdown of UGT379A1 increased the susceptibility of D. citri to lufenuron. In vitro metabolism and Dixon plot analysis indicated that UGT379A1 could deplete lufenuron by sequestration. These results showed that UGT379A1 was involved in the lufenuron detoxification, which provides a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of D. citri.
40015849	Risk assessment of broflanilide resistance in Panonychus citri (McGregor): Cross-resistance, inheritance and relative fitness.	Panonychus citri (McGregor) is an important economic pest in the orange orchard of the world, which has developed varying degrees of resistance to many acaricides. Broflanilide is a novel γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor allosteric modulator with high insecticidal activity against a broad spectrum of insects. However, the risk of resistance to broflanilide in P. citri has not been studied. In this study, the BR strain selected from susceptible strain of P. citri with broflanilide for 44 generations, developed 32.5-fold resistance to broflanilide, and did not exhibit cross-resistance to fipronil, fluxametamide, abamectin, pyridaben, and cyflumetofen. Broflanilide resistance in the BR strain of P. citri was autosomal, incomplete dominant and polygenic. The duration of larval and deutonymph, total life span and the number of eggs were significantly increased in the BR strain compared to the SS strain. The higher relative fitness (R<sub>f</sub>) value (1.289) indicated that there was a fitness advantage in the BR strain. Glutathione S-transferase and esterase activities in the BR strain were significantly increased compared with the SS strain. These findings provide valuable information for developing resistance management strategies to delay broflanilide resistance and maintain sustainable control of P. citri.
40015846	Biocontrol potential of the active substance isolated from the endophytic fungus Aa-Lcht against apple Valsa canker.	Apple Valsa canker (AVC), primarily caused by the pathogenic fungus Valsa mali, is a devastating disease of apple. The development and application of high efficiency and low toxicity fungicides are of great significance for disease control. Natural active substances serve as a vital foundation for the development of novel green fungicides. In previous studies, the endophytic fungus Aa-Lcht was confirmed to contain specific inhibitory effect against V. mali. This study confirmed that Aa-Lcht fermentation broth (FB)'s suppression of V. mali growth and conidial germination, exhibiting AVC prevention. Through extraction, isolation, and purification, one active substance with high inhibitory effect on V. mali was obtained and identified as altenusin. Its concentration value for 50 % of maximal effect (EC<sub>50</sub> values) against V. mali mycelium growth was 3.118 μg/mL. Before V. mali infection, the lesion length of apple twigs and lesion area of fruits pretreated with altenusin decreased by 47.27 % and 80.52 %, respectively. Further research revealed that the hyphae of V. mali treated with altenusin exhibited irregular thickening of cell walls, severe vacuolation within the cells, and protoplasmic exudation. Meanwhile, transcriptome analysis indicated that altenusin primarily inhibited V. mali by interfering with the normal hyphal cell metabolism, substance degradation, peptidase activity, and proteolysis functions. Additionally, altenusin could also significantly up-regulate the expression of immunity resistance-related genes MdCYP81F2, MdPR2, MdPR4, and MdPR5 in apple. Summarizing the above, the altenusin provides valuable insights for the development of novel green fungicides for controlling AVC disease, contributing to the safe and healthy development of apple production.
40015845	Toosendanin inhibits the growth of Spodoptera litura by inducing metabolic dysfunction in the midgut.	The Spodoptera litura, a crucial polyphagous pest, has emerged as a major threat to the agricultural sector. Regrettably, despite ongoing efforts, scientists have yet to uncover a safe and efficient control medication to tackle this pressing issue. Toosendanin (TSN), a commercial insecticidal active ingredient used to manage various pests in the field, has adverse effects on Spodoptera litura. However, the effects of TSN on the midgut of S. litura larvae remain unclear. This study explored the mechanism of TSN-induced toxicity and its inhibitory effects on larval growth and development using intestinal pathology, intestinal digestive enzyme activity determination, and intestinal transcriptome sequencing. The results indicated that TSN treatment led to pathological changes in the midgut structure. Analysis of digestive enzyme activity revealed that TSN inhibited the activities of acetyl CoA carboxylase, lipase, α-amylase, and trypsin. Simultaneously, it upregulated superoxide dismutase and reduced malondialdehyde content. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 2151 genes were significantly differentially expressed in the midgut after TSN exposure; the analysis highlighted significant enrichment of DEGs in areas such as hydrolase activity, carbohydrate metabolism, and peptide metabolism. Notably, some key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, protein metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism, such as pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase-like, pancreatic lipid-related protein 2-like, lipase3, alpha-amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin were downregulated following TSN treatment. This study's findings suggest that TSN causes midgut damage and inhibits larval growth by inducing metabolic dysfunction in the midgut.
40015843	Molecular identification of three cytochrome P450 genes and their potential roles in insecticides tolerance in Grapholita molesta (Busck).	The oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), is a significant pest of Rosaceae trees worldwide and has developed resistance to various insecticides. Cytochrome P450 play a major role in detoxification of resistance to insecticides in insects. In this study, we found that Piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which inhibits the P450 activity, synergized with abamectin, imidacloprid, and L-cyhalothrin, increasing mortality rates of G. molesta by 43.04 %, 31.66 %, and 59.09 %, respectively. Using previously constructed transcriptome data from G. molesta treated with these three insecticides, we identified and cloned three new cytochrome P450 genes-CYP4L57 (OR027029), CYP9A114 (OR027031), and CYP9A203 (OR027030). These genes were highly expressed in adults, with CYP4L57 showing a 123.90-fold increase, CYP9A114 a 43.89-fold increase, and CYP9A203 a 1498.99-fold increase compared to egg stages. Tissue-specific expression analysis revealed CYP4L57 was predominantly expressed in the head, CYP9A114 in the hindgut, fat body, and Malpighian tubules, and CYP9A203 in the midgut, ovary, and hindgut. Molecular docking demonstrated strong binding interactions between these P450 genes and the insecticides. RNA interference-mediated silencing of CYP4L57, CYP9A114, and CYP9A203 significantly increased mortality rates by 12.42 % to 68.89 % upon exposure to the insecticides, abamectin, imidacloprid, and L-cyhalothrin. These findings suggest that cytochrome P450 genes contribute to insecticide tolerance in G. molesta and CYP4L57, CYP9A114, and CYP9A203 play key roles in this process.
40015842	Flusulfinam, a novel amide herbicide to control weed in rice fields, targets 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase.	Flusulfinam, a post-emergence (POST)-applied herbicide in rice fields to manage annual weeds, has been proven to be safe for various rice strains of japonica and indica. The study confirmed its mechanism of action by inhibiting 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). The POST application of flusulfinam led to noticeably bleaching symptom in leaves of Echinochloa crus-galli within 3 to 7 days and plant mortality by 10 days. In Echinochloa crus-galli, flusulfinam induced a significant rise in level of phytoene content, while there was a significant decrease in levels of carotenoid and chlorophyll contents. Meanwhile, the increase in levels of chlorophyll content in Spirodela polyrrhiza treated with flusulfinam after homogentisic acid (HGA) addition was observed, suggesting that flusulfinam inhibited HGA production, likely by suppressing HPPD activity. Flusulfinam significantly diminished the catalytic activity of recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana HPPD that was expressed by Escherichia coli, exhibiting an inhibitory efficacy approximately 16-fold higher than the HPPD-inhibiting mesotrione. Additionally, the rice with overexpression of Oryza sativa HPPD showed higher tolerance to flusulfinam than rice of wild type. Furthermore, molecular docking analyses revealed that flusulfinam formed effective bonds with the HPPD active site via the nitrogen atom of the oxadiazole ring and the oxygen atom of the amide group, with distances of 2.0 Å and 2.4 Årespectively, which engaged in bidentate coordination with the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion, with a binding energy of -8.7 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, and HPPD-flusulfinam complex showed low root-mean square deviation values of less than 2 Å in molecular dynamics tests. This study provides the first evidence of the molecular targets of flusulfinam.
40015841	Differential pathogenicity of heterologous nucleopolyhedroviruses on Spodoptera frugiperda corresponds to modulated expression of immune-response-related genes.	The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a notorious invasive pest wreaking havoc on various crops globally. Nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) are viral pathogens that specially target lepidopteran pests. However, the homologous virus, Spodoptera frugiperda multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SfMNPV), has not been commercialized in China. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying heterologous virus-host interactions can inform the design of virus-based insecticides for controlling S. frugiperda. The pathogenicity of the four heterologous NPVs on S. frugiperda varied greatly. Mamestra brassicae multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (MbMNPV) exhibited the most potent virulence on larvae and induced the most robust sublethal effects on adults. Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) infection was characterized by more moderate pathogenicity, and larvae were relatively resistant to Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaSNPV) and Spodoptera litura multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SlMNPV). Larval mortality was virus-concentration and larval stage dependent. Specifically, the corrected mortality rate of third instar larvae after treatment with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>7</sup>, and 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> OBs/mL MbMNPV was 88.9 %, 100.0 %, and 100.0 %, respectively. All four NPVs negatively affected the longevity and fecundity of S. frugiperda adults. Female adults surviving treatment with MbMNPV and SeMNPV were unable to lay eggs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that MbMNPV infection might suppress the antiviral immune response, and dysregulate biological pathways of S. frugiperda larvae to facilitate systemic infection. However, the overall transcript profiles remain unchanged after SlMNPV infection. The results reinforce the potential of NPVs, specifically MbMNPV, as potent biocontrol agents for S. frugiperda. These findings yield valuable insights into the complex arms race between S. frugiperda and NPVs that may advance the development of virus-based strategies to mitigate the destructive impact of this pest.
40015840	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the melanization gene ebony in the 28-spotted ladybeetle, Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata.	The melanization process, which is essential for the proper functioning of the cuticle, has been extensively investigated for its enzymatic roles and physiological effects. Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata, a significant pest species, presents considerable economic threats. However, due to the variable efficiency of RNA interference for genetic manipulation, establishing a CRISPR/Cas9 system is crucial for providing a more precise and reliable method for functional genomics in this non-model insect. In this study, we first utilized RNAi to investigate Hvebony, which encodes N-β-alanyldopamine, a critical compound in cuticle melanization. Subsequently, we introduced CRISPR/Cas9 for the first time in H. vigintioctopunctata. RNAi experiments revealed that knockdown of Hvebony resulted in abnormal melanin accumulation and low mortality rates, indicating its involvement in cuticle tanning. A novel CRISPR/Cas9 workflow was established, successfully resulting in the knocking out of Hvebony and the creation of a stable mutant strain characterized by dark pigmentation and low fitness costs. This study establishes Hvebony as a promising molecular marker for genetic studies in H. vigintioctopunctata. Moreover, it can be utilized in the development of genome editing control strategies and for analyses of gene function in H. vigintioctopunctata.
40015838	Phenolic acid compounds isolated from Zanthoxylum armatum inhibit gray mold by disrupting cellular structures, affecting energy metabolism, and inducing oxidative stress of Botrytis cinerea.	Botrytis cinerea is a phytopathogenic fungus that utilizes multiple infection pathways and is known for causing gray mold on crops. This fungal infection results in the deterioration of crop quality and substantial economic losses. ZH-5, a phenolic acid compound derived from the methanol extract of the twigs of Zanthoxylum armatum DC., exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the mycelial growth, spore germination, and germ tube elongation of B. cinerea in in vivo experiments. The EC<sub>50</sub> of ZH-5 was determined to be 58.96 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, which surpassed the effectiveness of commonly used carbendazim and was comparable to the plant-derived pesticide eugenol. Our study focused on investigating the mechanisms underlying the antifungal activity of ZH-5. Our findings have demonstrated that ZH-5 has the ability to disrupt the integrity of cellular structures, including mitochondria. This disruption affects energy metabolism and induces oxidative stress, ultimately ZH-5 might be interfere with cellular activity or inhibit growth. In summary, we reported that ZH-5 demonstrated efficacy as a plant-derived compound against B. cinerea, making it a potentially valuable environmentally-friendly chemical agent for the management of gray mold.
40015837	Unveiling the resistance risk and resistance mechanism of florylpicoxamid in Corynespora cassiicola from cucumber.	Florylpicoxamid, a QiI fungicide, demonstrates broad-spectrum activity against a wide range of phytopathogenic organisms belonging to the phyla Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. Nevertheless, the potential for resistance and the underlying resistance mechanisms of Corynespora cassiicola against florylpicoxamid are still not fully understood. We determined the baseline sensitivity levels of 101 C. cassiicola isolates to florylpicoxamid. The EC<sub>50</sub> values varied from 0.01 to 1.18 μg/mL with an average of 0.50 μg/mL. Laboratory-induced fungicide adaptation of nine wild-type isolates generated seven C. cassiicola mutants exhibiting high level of resistance to florylpicoxamid, all originating from a single parental isolate. The mutants maintained their resistance even after undergoing ten successive cultivations on a medium devoid of fungicides. No cross-resistance was detected between florylpicoxamid and pyraclostrobin, fluopyram, prochloraz, or propineb. Five of the resistant mutants showed an improved compound fitness index (CFI) relative to their parental isolate, whereas the remainder displayed either a reduced or comparable CFI. All seven of the resistant mutants displayed an A37V substitution within the CcCytb protein, which was responsible for the resistance to florylpicoxamid, as validated through molecular docking analysis. Furthermore, an allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) method for detecting the CcCytb<sup>A37V</sup> mutation was successfully established. In summarize, the findings of this study indicate a moderate risk of C. cassiicola developing resistance to florylpicoxamid, with the A37V substitution in CcCytb playing a key role in this resistance, detectable through the use of specific AS-PCR primers.
40015836	Transcriptomic insights on impaired survival and enhanced pesticide susceptibility following knockdown of Syntaxin5 in Locusta migratoria.	Membrane fusion, essential for a variety of biological processes, is ubiquitous and critical in all living organisms. The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) comprise the core machinery that mediates membrane fusion. Syntaxin5 (Stx5) in mammals and its ortholog Sed5p in yeast are SNARE proteins that have been reported to mediate anterograde and retrograde endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi trafficking. In this study, a syntaxin5 gene (Lmsyx5) was cloned from the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, and its tissue expression pattern showed widespread expression in different tissues. Knockdown of this gene using RNA interference (RNAi) revealed that both 5<sup>th</sup> instars and adult locusts have reduced survival, and almost all of the 5<sup>th</sup> instar locusts died before molting. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that drug or xenobiotic metabolism-related pathways are the most significantly downregulated in the central nervous system (CNS) of the RNAi 5<sup>th</sup> instar locusts, whereas amino acid metabolism-related pathways are significantly downregulated in the muscle. In addition, receptor interaction-related pathways are downregulated in both the CNS and muscle. The mortality rate was significantly higher when dsLmsyx5 and beta-cypermethrin were combined together than when RNAi and chemical pesticides were used alone. Taken together, the Lmsyx5 gene is essential for locust survival, affects locust molting, is involved in the metabolism of both xenobiotics and endogenous chemicals in various tissues, and regulates locust susceptibility to chemical pesticides. It can thus be a potential target for locust control, and its knockdown using RNAi has great potential when combined with chemical pesticides.
40015835	Silencing OdfoP-gp1 and OdfoP-gp3 with dsRNA increased the lethality of the nonsteroidal ecdysone agonist RH-5849 against Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki).	Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki) is a highly damaging social insect that causes significant economic losses. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are efficient and environmentally friendly insecticides. 1,2-dibenzoyl-1-tert-butylhydrazine (RH-5849), a nonsteroidal ecdysone agonist of IGR, is highly effective in controlling various insect species. In this study, the toxicity of RH-5849 against O. formosanus was assessed. To investigate whether ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, detoxification enzymes, play crucial roles in the defense of O. formosanus against RH-5849, transcriptome sequencing was conducted in O. formosanus. Through RNA sequencing, 27 ABC transporter protein genes were identified, 23 of which were significantly upregulated after O. formosanus was exposed to RH-5849, especially two P-glycoprotein genes, OdfoP-gp1 and OdfoP-gp3, whose expression levels were the most significantly upregulated, at 5.79 and 5.56, respectively. Furthermore, using dsRNAs to interfere with the expression of OdfoP-gp1 and OdfoP-gp3, we found that the maximum interference efficiency was achieved at 24 h, with efficiencies of 85.30 % and 59.59 %, respectively. Based on these findings, dsRNA was coupled with RH-5849, and the results indicated that the lethality of RH-5849 against O. formosanus significantly increased following dsRNA interference. Overall, the lethality of RH-5849 significantly increased following dsRNA interference, suggesting that ABC transporter proteins, especially P-glycoproteins, play a crucial role in the defense of O. formosanus against RH-5849. This study provides a new strategy for termite control through the combination of dsRNA and IGR.
40015833	The role of 20-hydroxyecdysone and juvenile hormone in insecticidal activity of Bacillus thuringiensis regulated by DUOX-ROS immunity in Spodoptera exigua.	Insect midgut bacteria can be transferred to the blood cavity due to Bt infection and proliferate, becoming pathogens and enhancing Bt insecticidal activity. Dual oxidase (DUOX)-reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway plays a key role in regulating microbial homeostasis and resisting pathogen infection. However, the functions of MEKK and MKK associated with DUOX-ROS immunity are rarely studied in insects, moreover, the regulatory mechanisms underlying DUOX-ROS immunity via 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) are underexplored. In this study, we investigated that Spodoptera exigua MAPK kinase kinase 4 (SeMEKK4) and MAPK kinase 6 (SeMKK6) were required for Sep38β expression, and RNAi-mediated knockdown of SeMEKK4 and SeMKK6 significantly decreased ROS level and increased bacterial load in the midgut of S. exigua larvae, thereby enhancing Bt insecticidal activity. Furthermore, 20E and JH titers were elevated in insects infected with Bt. 20E upregulated the expression of SeMEKK4, SeMKK6, and Sep38β through SeEcR and SeUSP receptors, and activated the expression of SeDUOX to increase ROS level and decrease bacterial load in the midgut, which was not conducive to the enhancement of Bt insecticide activity. JH showed an opposite effect on midgut-related DUOX-ROS immunity via SeMet1 and SeMet2, and it was noteworthy that JH played a dominant role in negatively regulating DUOX-ROS immunity post Bt infection, which enhanced Bt insecticidal activity. This is an adjustment strategy for insects to cope with Bt infection, providing a new perspective for pest management.
40015832	Vitamin E alleviates zebrafish intestinal damage and microbial disturbances caused by pyraclostrobin.	Pyraclostrobin (PY) is highly toxic to aquatic organisms, and its increased residues in aquatic environments may have harmful effects on the intestine of aquatic creatures. Previous research demonstrated that vitamin E (VE) alleviated the acute toxicity of PY to zebrafish. This study further explored the mitigation effect of VE on PY-induced intestinal toxicity in fish and the underlying mechanisms by exposing adult zebrafish to PY (10, 20 μg/L) with or without 4 μM VE supplementation for 21 days. The results showed that VE alleviated the gut histopathological lesions caused by PY. VE co-exposure also improved PY-induced intestinal inflammation and restored the expression level of genes encoding intestinal tight junction protein. Furthermore, VE restored the anti-oxidation level inhibited by PY and reduced pro-apoptotic cytokine level and apoptotic enzyme activity increased by PY. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing showed that VE improved the zebrafish intestinal flora imbalance caused by 20 μg/L PY, increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacterium Cetobacterium, and reduced the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria. In conclusion, VE alleviated PY-induced intestinal toxicity via repairing the damaged intestinal mucosal barrier, inhibiting inflammation, reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis, and improving the intestinal microbial disorder in zebrafish.
40015831	Interaction between imidacloprid residues in maize rhizospheric soil and soil nematode community.	Although imidacloprid has been shown to present potential risks to non-target invertebrates and vertebrates, researches exploring this risk from the perspective of the underground ecosystem remains incomplete. In this study, we determined that the presence of imidacloprid significantly reduced the abundance and diversity of soil nematodes in maize rhizospheric soil. Furthermore, imidacloprid also exerted negative effects on the body length, reproduction, locomotion, lipid accumulation, lipofuscin accumulation, and acetylcholinesterase activity in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. These toxic phenotypes are correlated with the upregulation of fat-2, fat-6, hsp-16.41, and hsp-16.2, along with the downregulation of ace-1, ace-2, and ace-3. In response to these toxic effects of imidacloprid, nematodes also developed corresponding adaptive mechanisms. UPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that nematodes could convert imidacloprid to imidacloprid-guanidine and imidacloprid-urea to reduce the toxicity of imidacloprid. Moreover, C. elegans and Meloidogyne incognita exhibited repellent behavior towards imidacloprid-treated area, even the concentration of imidacloprid is only 0.4 μg/mL. This study revealed the interaction between imidacloprid and nematodes, providing a basis for understanding the potential risks of non-target soil nematodes after application of imidacloprid in sustainable agriculture and the resistance mechanism of nematodes to nematocidal pesticide.
40015778	Fabrication of microporous organic network incorporated monolithic column for improved high performance liquid chromatographic separation of small molecules.	As a class of boomingly developed porous material, microporous organic networks (MONs) demonstrated great prospects in HPLC because of their unique structures and excellent stabilities. However, the agglomerated, irregular, and sub-micron sized MONs obtained via the traditional synthesis methods inevitably cause high column pressure and low column efficiency, rendering the main obstacles for their applications in HPLC. Monolithic column has the characteristics of continuous porous structure, fast mass transfer rate, excellent permeability, and low column pressure. Therefore, the integration of MONs with monolithic column should be a potential way to extend the widespread applications of MONs in HPLC.
40015438	Insights of the coexisting fertilizers enhance metolachlor persistence in soil: Perspectives from mobility, metabolism, and microbiome.	Coexistence of fertilizers and pesticides in farmlands may alter the biodegradation of the latter. Herein, the effects of fertilizers, namely urea (N), superphosphate (P), potassium sulfate (K), compound fertilizers (NPK), chicken manure (CM), rice husk ash (PA) on the environmental behaviors of metolachlor (MET) are investigated. The sorption of MET is reduced by N and NPK at 1 mg/g (nitrogen content) but enhanced by CM and PA at 10 mg/g in soil. Meanwhile, these fertilizers inhibit the biodegradation of MET and prolonged its half-life to >3 times in soil, which microbial-mediated effect was verified via sterilized soil. To explore the profiles of fertilizer-domesticated microbes, correlation analysis reveals that the abundances of nine potential MET-degrading genera are reduced by the fertilizers, further inhibiting the metabolic pathways of MET ["MET oxanilic acid (MOA)" and "ethane sulfonic acid (ESA)" pathways], thus enhancing the persistence of MET in soil. In summary, excessive nitrogen fertilizers may increase the soil risks associated with MET residues, whereas CM and PA reduce the risk via immobilization of MET and inhibition of its metabolic transformation.
40015250	Recombinant DNA: unlocking untapped microbial potential for innovation in crop agriculture.	The Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, held in 1975, established guidelines for recombinant DNA (rDNA) research and laid the foundation for biotechnology regulations. While rDNA has driven significant advancements in pharmaceutical and crop biotechnology, the commercialization of plant-beneficial microbials developed using rDNA has lagged behind. This disparity may be attributed to a cumbersome regulatory framework shaped by the perception that rDNA products pose biosafety risks. To unlock the full potential of rDNA technology in addressing global challenges, regulatory reform for rDNA-derived microbial products for crop plants that reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides is essential. Streamlining these barriers will enable greater societal benefits from microbial solutions in agriculture and beyond.
40015197	SLR1-LPA1 signal regulates sheath blight resistance and lamina joint angle in rice.	Previous studies have suggested that Dense and Erect Panicle 1 (DEP1) interacts with Lose Plant Architecture 1 (LPA1) to regulate auxin transport by which DEP1-LPA1 modulates rice sheath blight (ShB) resistance. In this study, we identified that dep1 and lpa1 exhibited semi-dwarfism and dep1/lpa1 was shorter than the single mutant. LPA1 OX displayed higher height, whereas DEP1 OX exhibited similar height with wild-type. The gibberellic acid (GA)-dependent shoot growth was inhibited in dep1 and lpa1 while activated in LPA1 OX, suggesting that LPA1 may play a role in GA signaling transduction. Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed that slender rice 1 (SLR1), a GA signaling negative regulator, interacted with LPA1. Additionally, slr1 was less susceptible to ShB, whereas the GA signaling positive regulator DWARF1 mutant d1 was more susceptible to ShB. This suggested that GA signaling positively regulates rice resistance to ShB. Furthermore, slr1 was similar to LPA1 OX in terms of reduced lamina joint angle, whereas d1 did not show any difference. This implied that SLR1 may regulate LPA1 dependent signaling to control the lamina joint angle via a mechanism that was independent of GA signaling. Transcriptome data indicated that GA signaling and catabolic genes were regulated by LPA1. Transient and ChIP assays suggested that LPA1 bound to the promoter of gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase, a GA catabolic gene, to activate its expression. These findings indicated that LPA1 modulated GA homeostasis and SLR1 interacted with and inhibited LPA1 to regulate ShB resistance and lamina joint angle in rice.
40015127	Fenoxycarb induces cardiovascular, hepatic, and pancreatic toxicity in zebrafish larvae via ROS production, excessive inflammation, and apoptosis.	Fenoxycarb, a carbamate insecticide, functions as a juvenile hormone agonist to inhibit pests, and its detection in aquatic environments is concerning because of its widespread application. These concerns have led to ecotoxicological studies on aquatic crustaceans; however, research on the effects of fenoxycarb on the developmental processes of organisms is limited. In the present study, the deleterious effects of fenoxycarb on zebrafish development and the related cellular mechanisms mediating this toxicity were addressed. Exposure to sublethal concentrations of fenoxycarb (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L) resulted in morphological defects in zebrafish larvae, particularly in the heart region, eyes, and body length. These defects were accompanied by an increase in the number of apoptotic cells and the upregulation of related gene expression. Moreover, fenoxycarb increased ROS production and the number of macrophages, and altered the expression of immune-related genes, thereby inducing inflammation. These results revealed various abnormalities in the heart, vasculature, liver, and pancreas, as confirmed by transgenic models, such as cmlc2:DsRed, fli1a:EGFP, and fabp10a:DsRed;elastase:GFP. These developmental impairments were associated with the altered expression levels of genes involved in the development and function of each organ. These results suggest that fenoxycarb can affect multiple organs through excessive inflammation during development and highlight its potent toxic effects on other non-target organisms.
40015064	Hypercrosslinked β-cyclodextrin polymer for the dispersive solid-phase extraction of organic pollutants from sea water and wastewater.	This work explores the application of a hypercrosslinked β-cyclodextrin based polymer (called as "nanosponge", NS), as sorbent for the dispersive solid-phase extraction of a group of 48 organic pollutants from sea and wastewater. Extraction parameters such as type and volume of extraction solvent, amount of NS, adsorption and desorption time were optimized and applied to the extraction of thirteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, fourteen polychlorinated biphenyls, eleven organochlorine pesticides, two organophosphorus esters, seven UV filters and one antibacterial agent from both types of water. The extracts were analysed by gas chromatography coupled with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer allowing the determination of the 48 analytes in a 32 min chromatographic run. Under optimal conditions, the method showed good linearity, with R<sup>2</sup> > 0.99 for most of the analytes in both matrices. The limits of quantification were in the range 8 ng/L - 2 μg/L for sea water and 11 ng/L - 1.4 μg/L for wastewater. Excellent results were also obtained in terms of recovery for the majority of analytes, reporting an average value of 85 % and 88 % and an average RSD of 5 and 6 %, for sea water and wastewater, respectively. To evaluate the applicability and sustainability of the proposed method, it was subjected to Blue Applicability Grade Index (BAGI) metric and to Sample Preparation Metric of Sustainability (SPMS) achieving a total score of 67.5 and 7.05, respectively.
40015044	Co-exposure of pyraclostrobin and biochar promoted antibiotic resistance genes transfer from soil to lettuce.	The widespread presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) threatens ecological security and human health. In agricultural production, the simultaneous presence of non-antibiotic substances fungicides and biochar utilized for soil remediation has unclear effects on the spread of ARGs in the soil-vegetable systems. Herein, this study conducted a pots experiment and found that biochar significantly reduced pyraclostrobin accumulation in the soil and lettuce roots. Simultaneously, the co-exposure of pyraclostrobin and biochar increased the microbial community alpha diversity and the abundance of ARGs in soil, while promoting the transfer of ARGs from soil to lettuce. Proteobacteria were identified as potential primary carriers of ARGs. Planting lettuce mitigated the effects of pyraclostrobin or/and biochar on ARGs accumulation in soil. Furthermore, MGEs and bacterial community abundance were the most important direct factors increasing ARGs in soil and lettuce. Overall, these findings evaluated the combined effects of non-antibiotic substances fungicides and soil remediation materials biochar on the generation and transmission of ARGs, providing potential strategies for controlling ARGs transfer in soil-vegetable systems.
40015043	From victims to protectors: Microalgae's unexpected capacity for diuron elimination.	Diuron is a widespread PSII-inhibiting herbicide that persists in aquatic ecosystems and threatens environmental health. However, cost-effective removal solutions remain elusive. This study revealed that microalgae have the ability to remove diuron efficiently under mixotrophic conditions, e.g., Parachlorella kessleri could completely remove 60 μg·L<sup>-1</sup> of diuron within 60 hours. The primary process of this removal is bioabsorption, which relies more on new biomass generation than on total biomass. Additionally, diuron significantly enhances the mixotrophic growth of P. kessleri by maintaining a stable pH environment, stabilizing between 7.0 and 7.5 without the need for buffers or adjustments. This pH stabilization is attributed to diuron's reduction of the alkalizing effect of microalgal photosynthetic carbon assimilation. Other microalgae species, including Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella ellipsoidea and Scenedesmus quadricauda, also show high diuron removal efficiencies and growth promotion under mixotrophic conditions. These findings collectively suggest that the use of mixotrophic microalgae could represent a new potential method for diuron removal.
40015042	Direct photodegradation of aromatic carbamate pesticides: Kinetics and mechanisms in aqueous vs. non-aqueous media.	The direct photodegradation quantum yields (Φ) of five representative aromatic carbamate pesticides - carbaryl, carbofuran, propoxur, isoprocarb, and metolcarb - were examined in both aqueous and non-aqueous solutions, the latter mimicking hydrophobic environments such as leaf surfaces. For carbaryl, carbofuran, isoprocarb, and metolcarb, the Φ values generally followed the order Φ<sub>water</sub> < Φ<sub>MeOH</sub> < Φ<sub>n-hexane</sub>, while propoxur showed a different trend, Φ<sub>MeOH</sub> < Φ<sub>n-hexane</sub> < Φ<sub>water</sub>. Scavenging and laser flash photolysis experiments, combined with quantum chemical calculations, were used to clarify the photodegradation mechanisms. Photodegradation is primarily initiated by the singlet excited state (S*), with the triplet state (T * ) also contributing in compounds with conjugated structures, such as carbaryl. Upon excitation, methylcarbamate aromatic esters (MCAEs) generated both radical cations (S<sup>•+</sup>) and phenoxyl radicals (S-O<sup>•</sup>), and S<sup>•+</sup> would convert to S-O<sup>•</sup> subsequently. S-O<sup>•</sup> is predominantly generated through the cleavage of C-O bonds in ester groups, subsequently abstracting hydrogen from solvent molecules. The reactivity of hydrogen donors in these solvents follows the order: -CH<sub>2</sub>- > -CH<sub>3</sub> > -OH. For propoxur, the ether group also contributes to the formation of S-O<sup>•</sup>, which further reacts with H<sub>2</sub>O and enhances degradation in aqueous environments. Solvent polarity had a minimal effect on photodegradation. This comparative study of degradation in aqueous and nonaqueous phases provides insights for designing and selecting pesticides that are effective during use in nonaqueous environments, such as on leaf surfaces, yet degrade rapidly in aqueous environments in the post-application phase.
40014941	Bridging the gap between research and decision making: A European survey to enhance cooperation in wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for illicit drugs.	Illicit drug use presents a significant challenge to global health and public safety, requiring innovative and effective monitoring strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the current landscape of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for monitoring illicit drugs in Europe, focusing on collaboration, current practices, and barriers, while identifying opportunities for improvement.
40014758	Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Asymmetrical Disulfides Based on Garlic Extract as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa pqs</i> Quorum Sensing Inhibitors.	<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> is a widely encountered bacterium linked to the deterioration of food products and represents a notable concern for public health safety. Disulfides serve as significant pharmacologically active scaffolds exhibiting antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer properties; however, reports on their activity as quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> are limited. In our work, asymmetrical disulfides were designed and synthesized, utilizing natural products, such as allicin, ajoene, diallyl disulfide (DADS), hordenine, and cinnamic acid, as lead compounds. By screening for <i>lasB</i>, <i>rhlA</i>, and <i>pqsA</i> promoter activity, two highly effective QSIs were identified. Compounds <b>7d</b> and <b>4c</b> show effectiveness in reducing the synthesis of different virulence factors, the creation of biofilms, and movement capabilities. Subsequent validation using the <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae model confirmed their robust in vivo efficacy. Moreover, their combination with antibiotics markedly augmented the antibacterial activity. Mechanism studies employed by transcriptome analysis, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), surface plasmon resonance, and molecular docking demonstrate that compound <b>7d</b> disrupts the quorum sensing system by interacting with PqsR. These findings suggest that our disulfide derivatives hold promise for treating <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infections.
40014715	Too much of a good thing: Lessons from compromised rootworm Bt maize in the US Corn Belt.	Widespread use of genetically engineered maize targeting the corn rootworm complex (<i>Diabrotica</i> species) has raised concerns about insect resistance. Twelve years of university field trial and farm survey data from 10 US Corn Belt states indicate that maize hybrids expressing toxins derived from the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt maize) exhibited declining protection from rootworm feeding with increased planting while pest pressures simultaneously decreased. The analysis revealed a tendency to overplant Bt maize, leading to substantial economic losses; this was particularly striking in eastern Corn Belt states. Our findings highlight the need to go beyond the "tragedy of the commons" perspective to protect sustainable use of Bt and other crop biotechnology resources. We propose moving toward a more diversified and transparent seed supply.
40014703	Assessing market failures driving pesticide resistance.	Some US farms' use of transgenic Bt corn raises questions.
40014583	Plasmodium and intestinal parasite infections among pregnant women at first antenatal care contact in northwest Ethiopia: A study of prevalence and associated risk factors.	Parasitic infections in pregnancy are detrimental for both the mother and her fetus. Malaria and intestinal parasite infections among pregnant women at their first antenatal care contact (ANC1) could offer information on their burden in pregnancy, community-level transmission, and intervention coverage, which is vital for targeted interventions. However, data is scarce in Ethiopia. This study investigated Plasmodium and intestinal parasite infections along with their associated risk factors among pregnant women at their ANC1 in northwest Ethiopia.
40014423	2,4-Epibrassinolide Regulates Polysaccharide Substance Biosynthesis after Field Application to <i>Dendrobium officinale</i>.	This study investigated the effects of 2,4-epibrassinolide (EBR) residues on <i>Dendrobium officinale</i> quality. The residues decreased from 0.164 to 0.238 mg/kg (2 h) to 0.014-0.071 mg/kg (35 d) in the stems with 0.02-0.05 mg/L EBR applications. Polysaccharide, mannose, and glucose content were increased in the stems and leaves, reaching a maximum of 61% in dried stems on 35 d. The increase in content may result from the significant upregulation of enzyme activities, including UGP, SUS, and SPS. Further analysis by nontargeted metabolomics revealed 5 upregulated (UDP-l-rhamnose, mannose-6-phosphate, GDP-mannose, chitobiose, and N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-phosphate) and 13 downregulated metabolites associated with polysaccharide and monosaccharide growth in the 0.02-0.05 mg/L EBR treatments. These differential metabolites regulate the biosynthesis of polysaccharides mainly through key metabolic pathways, such as glucose and fructose metabolism. These results provide a reference for the regulatory mechanisms governing the quality indicators of <i>Dendrobium officinale</i> after EBR application.
40014302	Functional Characterization of an Antenna-Biased Odorant Receptor AaOr96 Involved in Tea Tree Oil Repellency Against <i>Aedes aegypti</i>.	Numerous essential oils have been well acknowledged as eco-friendly alternatives to combat insect pests due to synthetic insecticide-induced pest resistance and environment pollution. As a highly commercial essential oil, tea tree oil exhibits excellent insecticidal and repellent activities. However, the molecular mechanism of the olfactory system mediating the tea tree oil-induced repellency against insect pests remains unknown. In our study, mosquito was used as a suitable model to examine the molecular mechanism of tea tree oil-induced repellency against insect pests. The results showed that tea tree oil exhibited excellent spatial and oviposition repellency against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> adults and outstanding repellency against larvae, which were conferred by the main constituent terpinen-4-ol. The reduced repellency in the <i>Orco</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mutant strain revealed that tea tree oil-induced repellency against mosquitoes was dependent on odorant receptor(s). Moreover, we identified one antenna-biased odorant receptor, AaOr96, that was involved in detecting constituents of tea tree oil to elicit repellency, and the predicted protein-ligand complex indicated that AaOr96 interacted with terpinen-4-ol via van der Waals forces from five key residues. Finally, knocking out <i>AaOr96</i> resulted in a reduced spatial repellency against <i>A. aegypti</i> by tea tree oil and terpinen-4-ol, and a reduced oviposition repellency by terpinen-4-ol, but not by tea tree oil. Our study not only reveals that tea tree oil has great potential in pest management but also provides more insights into the molecular basis of repellency of essential oils.
40014288	Biosynthesis of nickel nanoparticles using Enterobacter cloacae: characterization and multifaceted applications.	This study describes the biosynthesis of nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs) using gram-negative bacterium, Enterobacter cloacae. The synthesized Ni NPs were annealed at 350 °C for 3 h and characterized using various techniques. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of Ni NPs with an average crystallite size of 48.78 nm. UV-Vis spectroscopy exhibited an absorption peak at 394 nm, while FTIR confirmed a peak at 416 nm. Field emission scanning electron microscopy showed the Ni NPs as a mixture uniform distribution, characterized by almost uniform spherical or hexagonal shapes. The Ni NPs demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity but exhibited notably high biofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa species, suggesting their potential in combating biofilm-associated infections. Additionally, the biosynthesized Ni NPs showed promising larvicidal and Insecticidal activities. This study provides an eco-friendly and cost-effective method for synthesizing Ni NPs and highlights their multifaceted applications in healthcare and pest control.
40014251	Corydaline Alleviates 1-Methyl-4-Phenylpyridium (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-Induced Human Neuroblastoma Cell Injury by BAP1-NRF2/HO-1/GPX4 Pathway.	Corydaline (Cory) is a naturally extracted acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. In this study, we aimed to explore the possible roles and functions in Parkinson's disease (PD) using 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-induced human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. SK-N-SH cells were treated with MPP<sup>+</sup> to mimic PD in vitro model. MTT assay and EdU assay were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to analyze cell apoptosis. ELISA kits were adopted to examine the concentrations of inflammatory factors. Ferroptosis-related markers were determined by related commercial kits. qRT-PCR and western blot were utilized to measure the expression of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1). MPP<sup>+</sup> treatment repressed the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis, inflammation and ferroptosis in SK-N-SH cells. Cory alleviated MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced damage of SK-N-SH cells. BAP1 level was induced by MPP<sup>+</sup> in SK-N-SH cells, while Cory treatment relieved the effect. Moreover, Cory ameliorated MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced SK-N-SH cell injury by altering BAP1 expression. Additionally, we demonstrated that Cory regulated NRF2, HO-1 and GPX4 expression in MPP<sup>+</sup>-treated SK-N-SH cells through BAP1. Cory alleviated MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced human neuroblastoma cell injury by modulating BAP1-NRF2/HO-1/GPX4 pathway, which might provide a novel regulatory axis in PD development.
40014204	Genetic Variability of Dalbulus maidis Populations from Brazil and Their Infectivity with Pathogens of Corn Stunt Complex.	The corn leafhopper, Dalbulus maidis (DeLong & Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), is a key pest of maize crops in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. In addition to direct damage, its major impact is related to its action as insect vector of pathogens related to corn stunting complex (CSC). CSC diseases are currently the most important and cause severe crop losses in Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, and the southern United States, and outbreaks have been more oftenly reported. Little information is available on the population characteristics of the corn leafhopper and its bioecology. In this sense, we analyzed the genetic diversity of 120 representative specimens of D. maidis from four regions of Brazil (Northeast, Southeast, South, and Central-West) using a region of the mitochondrial gene coding for the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) as molecular marker. In addition, the infectivity of the collected insects with CSC pathogens was assessed to verify the prevalence of each CSC pathogen in specimens collected from different regions of Brazil. The Brazilian D. maidis population studied was divided into 18 mitochondrial haplotypes, focusing on haplotypes A, B, and C, which are predominant in this country. In addition, the mtCOI gene of D. maidis was found to have low variability in Brazil (π = 0.00171). Our data suggest that there are no spatial or temporal barriers between the different populations of D. maidis studied, which could be due to a short evolutionary time and its outstanding dispersion capacity. In addition, this study revealed a prevalence of infected leafhoppers with any of the CSC pathogens in Brazil, with more than half of the samples analyzed carrying at least one of the phytopathogens studied. Our study provides insights on population pest management of D. maidis in order to prevent CSC incidence in maize crops and pest resistance development in these vector populations to agricultural pesticides.
40014165	Bioaccessibility of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE in tropical soil ecosystems: a model based on pollutant speciation coefficients and the desorption free energy of adsorbed speciation forms.	The bioaccessibility of organic pollutants in the environment depends on the nature and speciation of the contaminants and is determined using in vitro methods that simulate gastro-intestinal digestion. The objectives of the present study were to study the bioaccessibility coefficients of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE in tropical soils based on the physico-chemical properties of the contaminant. The behavior of organic contaminants in soil ecosystems is characterized by their speciation and persistence, both of which depend on the extent to which the contaminant adsorbs to particulates in the soil matrix, as revealed in the characteristic persistence curve of the contaminant. Data are presented showing that the bioaccessibility coefficient of soil contaminants can be represented by a model based on the contaminant's speciation coefficients in the sample matrix, the desorption free energy of contaminant adsorbed speciation forms and temperature, provided its dissipation conforms to the multi-phase pseudo-zero order rate law. When the model was applied to determine the bio-accessibility coefficients of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE in tropical soils based on previously published data from the literature, mean bioaccessibility coefficient values of 0.30 ± 0.21 (n = 8) and 0.35 ± 0.13 (n = 9) (p,p'-DDT), and 0.43 ± 0.05 (n = 4) and 0.20 ± 0.01 (n = 2) (p,p'-DDE), were obtained depending on whether determinations were carried out using chromatographic or radiotracer methods. The results fall within the range of literature values obtained using in vitro methods, thus attesting to the potential of the model presented for predicting the bioaccessibility coefficients of persistent organic pollutants in soil ecosystems.
40014012	Novel application of ribonucleoprotein-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in plant pathogenic oomycete species.	CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has become an important tool for the study of plant pathogens, allowing researchers to functionally characterize specific genes involved in phytopathogenicity, virulence, and fungicide resistance. Protocols for CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing have already been developed for Phytophthoras, an important group of oomycete plant pathogens; however, these efforts have exclusively focused on agricultural pathosystems, with research lacking for forest pathosystems. We sought to develop CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in two forest pathogenic Phytophthoras, <i>Phytophthora cactorum</i> and <i>P. ramorum</i>, using a plasmid-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) co-transformation approach. Our gene target in both species was the ortholog of <i>PcORP1</i>, which encodes an oxysterol-binding protein that is the target of the fungicide oxathiapiprolin in the agricultural pathogen <i>P. capsici</i>. We delivered liposome complexes, each containing plasmid DNA and CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs, to <i>Phytophthora</i> protoplasts using a polyethylene glycol-mediated transformation protocol. We obtained two <i>ORP1</i> mutants in <i>P. cactorum</i> but were unable to obtain any mutants in <i>P. ramorum</i>. The two <i>P. cactorum</i> mutants exhibited decreased resistance to oxathiapiprolin, as measured by their radial growth relative to wild-type cultures on oxathiapiprolin-supplemented medium. Our results demonstrate the potential for RNP-mediated CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in <i>P. cactorum</i> and provide a foundation for future optimization of our protocol in other forest pathogenic <i>Phytophthora</i> species.IMPORTANCECRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has become a valuable tool for characterizing the genetics driving virulence and pathogenicity in plant pathogens. CRISPR-Cas9 protocols are now well-established in several <i>Phytophthora</i> species, an oomycete genus with significant economic and ecological impact globally. These protocols, however, have been developed for agricultural <i>Phytophthora</i> pathogens only; CRISPR-Cas9 systems have not yet been developed for any forest pathogenic Phytophthoras. In this study, we sought to establish CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in two forest <i>Phytophthora</i> pathogens that cause widespread tree mortality: <i>P. cactorum</i> and <i>P. ramorum</i>. We successfully obtained gene mutations in <i>P. cactorum</i> and demonstrated a decrease in fungicide resistance, a trait that could impact the pathogen's ability to cause disease. However, the same protocol did not yield any mutants in <i>P. ramorum</i>. The results of our study will serve as a baseline for the development of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in forest Phytophthoras and other oomycetes.
40013788	Phylogenetic analysis of plant-pathogenic and non-pathogenic <i>Trichoderma</i> isolates on maize from plants, soil, and commercial bio-products.	Fungi of the genus <i>Trichoderma</i> are primarily associated with the mycobiome of dead wood but can also be occasionally found in soil and plant rhizospheres. Several <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. are used in crop health management to promote growth and control plant diseases. Although widely considered beneficial to plants, some members have been reported to be pathogenic to maize, causing a disease called <i>Trichoderma</i> ear rot. Since 2018, <i>Trichoderma afroharzianum</i> has caused significant infections of maize cobs in Germany, France, and Italy. This study aimed to investigate the pathogenicity and phylogenetic relationships among different <i>Trichoderma</i> strains from diverse sources and geographical origins. While previous studies primarily identified <i>T. afroharzianum</i> as the main species causing <i>Trichoderma</i> ear rot, this study found that isolates of <i>T. asperellum</i>, <i>T. atroviride,</i> and <i>T. guizhouense</i> may also exhibit pathogenicity on maize cobs. Additionally, <i>Trichoderma</i> strains from commercial biocontrol products displayed unexpected pathogenicity inducing up to 92% disease severity on maize cobs. Most <i>T. afroharzianum</i> strains induced high levels of disease severity, although some isolates of the same species did not cause any disease, indicating a large heterogeneity in pathogenicity within the species. Notably, phylogeny reconstruction based on the <i>tef1-α</i> and <i>rpb2</i> genes did not result in any discernible clustering between pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates. A further novel finding is the isolation of pathogenic <i>Trichoderma</i> isolates from agricultural soil, demonstrating that soil can serve as a reservoir for pathogenic species. This study highlights the need for biosecurity assessment and monitoring of <i>Trichoderma</i> strains for agricultural use, considering their beneficial and pathogenic potential.IMPORTANCEIn this study, we explored the ability of different <i>Trichoderma</i> species to infect maize plants. <i>Trichoderma</i> is a group of fungi known for its beneficial role in agriculture, often used as a biological pesticide to control fungal plant diseases. However, some species within this genus can also act as pathogens, causing infections in crops like maize. We found that one species, <i>T. afroharzianum</i>, is particularly aggressive, capable of infecting maize without the plant being wounded first. This makes it a potentially serious threat to crop health. In contrast, other species, such as <i>T. atroviride</i> and <i>T. asperellum</i>, only caused infections when maize plants were injured before. Our research suggests that pathogenic <i>Trichoderma</i> species not only effectively infect plants but can also survive well in soil, making their control difficult. These findings highlight the need for better understanding of how these fungi operate in order to manage the risks they pose to important crops like maize, while still taking advantage of their beneficial uses in agriculture.
40013666	[A parasitic infection as an unwanted souvenir].	A 27-year-old patient came to the dermatology outpatient clinic of the Erasmus MC because of progressive swelling, pain, itching and skin lesions of the left foot for two days. The symptoms initially started with erythematous urticarial papules and vesicles. After a day severe swelling of the forefoot, bullae around the toes and several slowly progressive serpiginous plaques developed without systemic complaints. A week before the onset of the symptoms, he had returned from a trip to Colombia. Under the working diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans, ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg for two consecutive days, clobetasol, cetirizine and local compression therapy were started. Two weeks after the start of the treatment, the patient was symptom-free. The disease is self-limiting. In case of multiple lesions or severe reaction, treatment may be considered.
40013599	Investigation of the Antifungal Activity and Preliminary Mode of Action of Novel 2-(1<i>H</i>-Indol-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole Derivatives against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>.	The discovery of novel leads and new targets is an important approach to address the issue of fungicide resistance by new fungicide development. The indole skeleton has been widely utilized in agrochemicals due to its unique biological activity. YZK-C22 is a potent pyruvate kinase inhibitor with high antifungal activity. Several novel fungicide leads were developed based on YZK-C22. Inspired by these, the [1,2,4]triazino[4,5-<i>a</i>]indol-1(2<i>H</i>)-one derivatives were designed using a skeleton hopping strategy; however, these compounds exhibited moderate fungicidal activity. Unexpectedly, 2-(1<i>H</i>-indol-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives formed under controlled reaction conditions showed significantly higher fungicidal activity. Compounds <b>6c</b>, <b>6d</b>, <b>6f</b>, and <b>6j</b> exhibited excellent antifungal activity <i>in vitro</i>, with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.120 to 0.310 μg/mL against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, more potent than commercial fungicide pyrimethanil (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.990 μg/mL). In the field trials at 540 and 720 g of active ingredient (ai)/hm<sup>2</sup>, compound <b>6c</b> exhibited 81.46 and 86.58% efficacy against <i>B. cinerea</i>, higher than that of pyrimethanil at a rate of 540 g of ai/hm<sup>2</sup> (70.46%). The affinity constants of compounds <b>6c</b> and <b>6d</b> to pyruvate kinase from <i>B. cinerea</i> were lower than that of YZK-C22. Higher field efficacy but lower affinity to pyruvate kinase implies that these compounds may work as prodrugs or have a different mode of action. Thus, 2-(1<i>H</i>-indol-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives are worth being further investigated.
40013598	Plant protection treatments in Switzerland using unmanned aerial vehicles: regulatory framework and lessons learned.	Switzerland was the first European country to approve the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the purpose of plant protection treatments. The regulatory framework that has been established requires UAV sprayers to undergo a series of technical assessments that have generated a substantial amount of data. Here, we first describe the regulatory framework and the underlying rationales, followed by analyzing data from the technical assessments. The results show that the UAV sprayers being used in Switzerland achieve homogeneous transversal spray liquid distributions with coefficients of variation below 15 % at effective swath widths that are typically lower than those indicated by UAV manufacturers. Moreover, the lateral wind generated by the UAV sprayers as measured at distances of 10 m and 20 m, respectively, is not substantially affected by UAV size or weight. A survey we conducted to gain insight into agricultural practices under the current regulatory framework suggests that up to 11.5 % of the total of Swiss vineyards were treated with UAV sprayers in 2023. Other uses, such as spreading slug pellets, seem to gain importance as well. Finally, efficacy trials performed in Swiss vineyards suggest that UAV sprayers achieve limited control efficacy of powdery and downy mildew at high disease pressure, which is likely to be due to the relatively low amount of deposit around and on the bunches. We conclude this paper by outlining future regulatory challenges and directions for further development. © 2025 The Author(s).

40013394	Mating disruption of Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) using microencapsulated pheromone in cotton.	The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, has increased in importance as a pest over the past decade in Brazilian cotton fields. The limited efficacy of conventional management tools and rapid development of insecticide/ insecticidal proteins resistance is forcing growers to search for new and more sustainable solutions. Here, we report the results from two studies utilizing a microencapsulated sprayable pheromone formulation in Brazilian cotton fields. The first study aimed to define optimal timing to initiate spray applications, optimal number of spray applications and appropriate intervals between spray applications. The second study was a large-scale effort to estimate the efficacy provided by the pheromone sprayable formulation in reducing mating (using trapping reduction as a surrogate measure) and subsequent damage to cotton plants.
40012329	Metal-Free Alkane Functionalization by Organocatalytic and Photoinduced Methods.	Transforming alkane C-H bonds into carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds represents a paramount objective in synthetic chemistry with significant implications for sustainable production. Although transition-metal catalysts such as Pd, Rh etc have dominated this field, recent breakthroughs in metal-free approaches leveraging small-molecule catalysts or photogenerated intermediates have emerged as efficient and sustainable alternatives. These approaches facilitate precise C-H bond activation and selective formation of C-X (e. g., C, halogen, N, O) bonds under mild conditions, thereby paving a promising avenue for eco-friendly alkane transformations. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in homogeneous metal-free alkane functionalization, focusing on organocatalytic and photoinduced strategies, with the aim of enhancing mechanistic understanding and inspiring the development of innovative synthetic methodologies for the conversion of alkanes into high-value compounds.
40012074	Sustainable HEalthy Diet practices: a cross-sectional analysis of an adult Greek sample.	Sustainable nutrition is based on foods with a low environmental impact, accessible and affordable, ensuring protection of the biodiversity, while including the cultural elements of each geographical region. The present cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate adherence to a sustainable diet and the perceived environmental benefit of adopting a sustainable diet among adults in Greece.
40012073	Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry detection of Wolbachia in adult Dirofilaria immitis from dogs treated with doxycycline and ivermectin.	Wolbachia is present in all life stages of Dirofilaria immitis. Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) can be highly immunogenic and induce acute inflammatory reactions in the host upon worm death. To avoid the abrupt release of Wolbachia and its antigens from deceased parasites, the American Heartworm Society (AHS) has recommended using doxycycline (DOXY) and having a 1-month wait period between the DOXY treatment and the adulticidal process for Wolbachia elimination. Studies have shown that the 28 day, 10 mg/kg twice daily (BID) administration of DOXY can effectively clear Wolbachia in the bloodstream of the host. The 1-month wait period is hypothesized to allow for further reduction of Wolbachia. However, the levels of Wolbachia in adult parasites after the DOXY treatment remain unknown.
40011674	Assessment of quality in volatile oil from three basic sources of Xinyi from Hubei by anatomy, GC-MS, and chemometric methods.	"Xinyi" (Magnolia biondii Pampan., Magnolia denudata Desr., and Magnolia sprengeri Pampan.) is a traditional Chinese medicine listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. "Xinyi" has anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antioxidant, and antibacterial effects, and has significant curative effects in the treatment of acute and chronic rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, and other rhinitis symptoms. However, comparative quality assessments of these three species are scarce. This study investigated the variations in the volatile oil content and composition in the flower buds of M. biondii, M. denudata, and M. sprengeri using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the microscopic analysis at different growth stages. This study indicated the following findings. (1) The volatile oil levels varied among the species, with M. biondii, M. denudata, and M. sprengeri peaking, respectively. In addition, the cell density was positively correlated with the oil deposition. (2) The content of 1,8-Cineole varied significantly, where M. biondii exhibited the high levels at 14.50% at stage 4 and 16.40% at stage 5; M. denudata peaked at 17.87% at stage 5; and M. sprengeri was 1.07% at stage 3. Moreover, M. biondii and M. denudata from Hubei exceeded the Pharmacopoeia's 1% standard, whereas M. sprengeri did not. These findings underscore the need to improve the herb production standards and provide valuable data for assessing the therapeutic potential of these "Xinyi" species.
40011672	Ivermectin causes adverse effects on the metabolic rate and thermoregulatory capacity of Dung beetles.	Ivermectin (IVM), a commonly used endectocide in livestock, has been shown to produce adverse effects in dung beetle ecology, physiology, reproduction, and even their ecosystem services. However, the ever-growing ecological importance of thermoregulation and its associated metabolic demand in dung beetles has not received as much focus regarding the effects of this drug. Here, we evaluated experimentally the effects caused by IVM in the metabolic rate and thermoregulation of Ateuchetus cicatricosus (Lucas, 1846), using a standardized ecotoxicity test based on thermolimit respirometry combined with infrared thermography (TLR-IR). The total capacity of excess heat regulation (iTR) and the caloric metabolic rate (MR) gave the most sensitive responses to IVM ingestion. The inhibition concentration at 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>), a relevant toxicity threshold used to calculate the concentration of IVM that provokes a response half way among the inhibition responses obtained showed that iTR was impacted at 0.39 µg g<sup>-1</sup>, while the MR was compromised at 0.24 µg g<sup>-1</sup>. Applying a TLR-IR procedure has not only revealed how the MR of active thermoregulators is crucial for their adaptation in warm and competitive environments, but also shown the potential of this method to be applied in real-world scenarios like cattle-farming regions, where the need to assess the direct impact of endectocides like IVM is vital to update and enhance regulation guidelines of these pharmaceuticals.
40011407	Quality and sources of food and water consumed by people with chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology in Sri Lanka: a systematic review.	Prevalence data indicates that chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 15% of people worldwide, and chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) is highly prevalent in Sri Lanka. Food and water contamination are factors that were suggested as associated with CKDu. This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the patterns in quality and sources of food and water consumed by people with CKDu in Sri Lanka.
40011313	Boosting disease resistance in Solanum melongena L. (eggplant) against Alternaria solani: the synergistic effect of biocontrol Acinetobacter sp. and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).	Alternaria solani causes early blight disease in eggplants, threatening production and leading to significant economic losses. Fungicides are used to control fungal diseases, but their overuse raises resistance concerns. Finding novel, eco-friendly biocontrol agents is therefore a solution for the future. The coordination between antagonistic bacterial agents and plant growth hormones in defense responses against fungal pathogens are crucial. This study assessed biocontrol potential of Acinetobacter sp. SCR-11 (Accession no. OR751536.1) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA; 100 µM), singly and in combination, against A. solani in eggplants. Strain SCR-11 produced hydrogen cyanide (HCN; 5.7 µg mL⁻<sup>1</sup>), siderophore i.e. salicylic acid (14.7 µg mL⁻<sup>1</sup>), 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (23.1 µg mL⁻<sup>1</sup>) and various extracellular lytic enzymes. Strain SCR-11 exhibited antagonistic activity by strongly inhibiting (82%) A. solani. Acinetobacter sp. inoculation and IAA treatment enhanced growth, biomass, and leaf pigments of A. solani-diseased eggplants, with effectiveness in order: SCR-11 + IAA > SCR-11 > IAA >. The combined treatments (SCR-11 + IAA) most effectively increased total soluble protein (62.5%), carbohydrate (60%), total soluble sugar (81%), and phenol (74%) in A. solani-infected eggplant. Biocontrol agent and IAA application significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced proline and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, alleviating oxidative stress in A. solani-diseased eggplant. The SCR-11 + IAA treatment significantly reduced the percent disease index (71%) and increased protection (69%) in diseased eggplant. The Acinetobacter sp. and IAA coordination enhanced disease resistance in A. solani-infected eggplants by boosting defense enzyme activities (SOD, POD, PAL, and β-1, 3 glucanase), significantly protecting plants from pathogen attack. At harvest, soil populations of A. solani decreased, while SCR-11 populations increased significantly. Acinetobacter sp. and IAA work synergistically through pathogen suppression, plant growth promotion, and induction of plant defense responses. Thus, applying antagonistic PGPR strain with exogenous IAA enhances eggplant resistance to A. solani, providing an environmentally friendly agricultural solution.
40011307	Impact of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab Toxins on the Development of the Predator Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi Through Prey-Mediated Tri-trophic Interactions.	Adopting genetically modified crops in developing nations like India has consistently been hindered by apprehensions regarding their impact on non-target arthropods. Consequently, laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of Bt toxins of BG-II cotton on the common green lacewing [Chrysoperla zastrowi sillemi (Esben-Petersen)], indirectly exposing them to the toxins. Prey-mediated feeding bioassays, utilizing BG-II cotton and non-Bt cotton plants as hosts, two prey herbivores, specifically Aphis gossypii Glover and Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), were conducted on several days to assess the effects of Cry toxins on the growth of C. z. sillemi. The ELISA assay quantified the Cry toxins across three trophic levels and revealed that the leaves had the highest quantities of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab toxins, measuring 7.36 and 23.54 µg/g FW, respectively. In contrast, herbivores and predators exhibited very low concentrations of Cry toxins. Although traces of Cry toxins were found in both herbivores and predators, they had no negative impacts on any of the predator's developmental characteristics including total larval development period, pupal period, adult weight, adult longevity, and fecundity/female confirming that these toxins do not threaten C. z. sillemi.
40011290	Larvicidal Efficacy of Chloris virgata Extracts Against Aedes aegypti, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex quinquefasciatus with Insights into Mode of Action via Molecular Docking.	The indiscriminate use of synthetic insecticides for mosquito control has resulted in significant challenges, such as environmental pollution and growing insecticide resistance. In response, there is increasing interest in eco-friendly alternatives like plant-based larvicides. This study assesses the larvicidal efficacy of Chloris virgate (Poales: Poaceae) extracts against Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae), Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae), and Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae), and investigates the bioactive chemical compounds responsible for this activity. Soxhlet individual extraction was performed using n-hexane, chloroform, and ethanol, and methanol solvents are used separately to extract bioactive compounds from C. virgata. This approach allows for the selective extraction of specific compounds based on their solubility in each solvent. The extracts were tested on fourth instar larvae, and lethal concentrations (LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub>) were calculated via probit analysis. The methanol extract exhibited the lowest LC50 and LC90 values against Culex quinquefasciatus, with LC50 at 80.11 ppm and LC90 at 176.22 ppm, suggesting higher toxicity and effectiveness in larvicidal activity. Methanol extracts significantly affected mosquito larvae midguts, causing cytoplasmic thinning, muscle fiber disorganization, and brush border disruption. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified major compounds such as stigmasterol, campesterol, and γ-sitosterol. Campesterol, 4.alpha.,14-Dimethyl-5.alpha, and Lanosterol showed strong binding affinities with acetylcholine esterase (5X61), exhibiting multiple hydrophobic interactions with key residues, including TRP 441, TYR 282, and CYS 447. Campesterol also displayed significant binding to Sterol Carrier Protein-2 (1PZ4) and Odorant-Binding Protein (3OGN) with several hydrophobic interactions, achieving binding affinities of - 10.1 kcal/mol and - 9.7 kcal/mol, respectively. This study highlights the potential of C. virgata methanol extracts as a promising eco-friendly larvicide for mosquito population management.
40011281	The multifaceted roles of gut microbiota in insect physiology, metabolism, and environmental adaptation: implications for pest management strategies.	Similar to many other organisms, insects like Drosophila melanogaster, Hypothenemus hampei, and Cockroaches harbor diverse bacterial communities in their gastrointestinal systems. These bacteria, along with other microorganisms like fungi and archaea, are essential to the physiology of their insect hosts, forming intricate symbiotic relationships. These gut-associated microorganisms contribute to various vital functions, including digestion, nutrient absorption, immune regulation, and behavioral modulation. Notably, gut microbiota facilitates the breakdown of complex plant materials, synthesizes essential vitamins and amino acids, and detoxifies harmful substances, including pesticides. Furthermore, these microorganisms are integral to modulating host immune responses and enhancing disease resistance. This review examines the multifaceted roles of gut microbiota in insect physiology, with particular emphasis on their contributions to digestion, detoxification, reproduction, and environmental adaptability. The potential applications of gut microbiota in integrated pest management (IPM) are also explored. Understanding the microbial dynamics within insect pest species opens new avenues for pest control, including developing microbial biocontrol agents, microbial modifications to reduce pesticide resistance, and implementing microbiome-based genetic strategies. In particular, manipulating gut microbiota presents a promising approach to pest management, offering a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional chemical pesticides.
40011267	Sustainable microbial solutions for managing fungal threats in wheat: progress and future directions.	Biotrophic and necrotrophic fungi are responsible for causing a range of diseases in wheat, resulting in significant economic losses and a decline in quality. Effective management of these diseases generally involves a combination of resistance breeding, chemical treatments, and cultural practices. However, traditional breeding methods have made limited progress due to the slow pace of genetic improvements, the complexity of the wheat genome, and the quantitative nature of disease resistance traits, along with the constantly evolving virulence of pathogens. This situation has prompted research into more effective and eco-friendly alternatives, such as biological control. Recent studies have concentrated on using antagonistic microbes to decrease the reliance on chemical pesticides while enhancing wheat health and productivity. A comprehensive overview of current knowledge on wheat disease outbreaks is being developed, with a focus on advancements in biological control strategies. The review will first discuss the key fungal pathogens and their associated diseases, followed by a summary of biological control methods, particularly emphasizing potential microbial antagonists. Additionally, it will explore strategies to improve the efficacy of biocontrol agents, which are crucial for a holistic and sustainable approach to wheat disease management. Ultimately, the article will highlight the role of biological control in promoting more sustainable agricultural practices, particularly concerning wheat diseases, in alignment with the UN sustainable development goals.
40010727	[Validation of High-Sensitivity Analysis for Chloropropanols and Related Substances in Infant Formula].	Chloropropanols and related substances have received a great deal of attention in the world. Regulation values have already been established in the EU for infant formula. There are several validated analytical methods for these substances, such as the AOAC official method. However, no analytical official method has been established for infant formula in Japan. In this study, the AOAC official method was improved to a more versatile splitless injection method in order to make it feasible for many laboratories. The results of the validation data for the improved method with optimized injection conditions were as follows. The limit of quantification was 10 μg/kg, the recovery rate ranged from 81.6 to 114.5%, and the intermediate precision ranged from 1.6 to 7.6%. These results were adapt to AOAC and EU requirement and demonstrated the good validity of the improved method.
40010697	An Approach to Setting Vertebrate Animal-use Benchmarks for Agrochemical and GM Crop Testing to Facilitate Future Animal Reduction Efforts.	Agrochemical active ingredients are among the most toxicologically evaluated chemical substances, and genetically modified (GM) crops must be evaluated for safety and nutritional adequacy. Traditionally, these evaluations are conducted <i>in vivo.</i> There are concerted efforts in the agrochemical sector to reduce animal testing, but there is also an emphasis on updating test guidelines and fulfilling new data package requirements, which can both result in increased animal testing. The purpose of this project was to generate benchmarks for the numbers of vertebrate animals used in: a) evaluating agrochemical pesticidal active ingredients for human health hazards; and b) assessing GM crops for safety and nutritional adequacy, based on guideline studies for data package requirements. To achieve this, guideline studies employing vertebrates, as required by regulatory bodies for developing global data packages for new active ingredients and for GM crops, were listed. These listed guideline studies were reviewed, in terms of the study details and the required animal-use, which was determined based on best testing practices. For historical animal-use benchmarking, Corteva's six most recent agrochemical pesticidal active ingredients and four most recent GM crop events were evaluated. Across the six most recently developed active ingredients, an average of approximately 10,000 mammals were used for the testing of each (range: 5500-19,000); across the four most recently developed GM crops, the average number of vertebrates similarly used for each was approximately 1200 (range: 1000-1500). Though regulatory testing requirements are likely to change with time, as new technologies become available, this project has established a theoretical minimum requirement to help drive aspirational animal reduction goals, identified regulatory challenges associated with the reduction of animal-use, and helped to refine Corteva's vertebrate animal-use tracking approaches.
40010662	Assessment of health risk and burden of disease associated with dietary exposure to pesticide residues through foodstuffs in Iran.	The health risk and burden of disease associated with dietary exposure to pesticide residues in foodstuffs in Iran were assessed. The pesticide residue levels in foodstuffs in the country were determined through systematic review and meta-analysis. The non-carcinogenic risk, carcinogenic risk, and attributable burden of disease were estimated in terms of hazard quotient (HQ), incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR), and disability-adjusted life year (DALY), respectively. The meta-analysis showed that 58% of pesticide-food pairs lacked Codex maximum residue levels (MRLs), 34% had pesticide levels below these limits, and 8% exceeded them. Based on the average HQs, two foodstuffs (onion and tangerine) and two pesticides (haloxyfop-R-methyl and cyhalothrin) exhibited unacceptable non-cancer risk (>1.0). The average ILCR value of lindane was assessed to be at the unacceptable level (1.4 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). The total annual disease burden values attributable to pesticide residues in foodstuffs were assessed to be 242 for death cases, 0.29 for death rate (per 100,000 people), 13,792 for DALYs, and 16.1 for DALY rate. The three food items with the highest DALY rates from pesticide residues were cucumber (5.9), fish (3.9), and date (2.1). The health risk and disease burden of pesticide residues in foodstuffs were considered to be relatively high.
40010593	Assessing the influence of chlorantraniliprole on agricultural soils: Dissipation kinetics, degradation, microbial activity and functional biodiversity.	A comprehensive evaluation of the use of plant protection products (PPP) of the pesticide chlorantraniliprole (CAP) in soils has been done considering chemical and microbiological aspects. The study has been focused on the two most representative soil textures in greenhouse in the Southeast of Spain, clay (CS) and sandy clay loam soil (SCLS). The research has been divided into two phases, including laboratory (for 7 months) and field (for 2 months) studies to expand information on the behavior of the target pesticide in soils and their microorganisms. A combination of ultrasound-assisted QuEChERS extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with Q-Exactive-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap) was validated to determine the fate of the parent pesticide and its metabolites and has shown the great persistence characteristic of CAP in soil, with half-lives of 210 days under laboratory conditions and 86 days in the field study, fitting to first and biphasic kinetic models of dissipation, respectively. The suspect screening has allowed the additional detection of 6 metabolites in the laboratory and 2 metabolites in the field studies. The 5-bromo-N-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide metabolite has been detected in both laboratory and field studies, but also a previously undescribed metabolite N-methylprop-1-en-2-amine. Finally, a study of the impact of this PPP on the soil microbiota, a clear indicator of the state of an ecosystem or crop, revealed that after three months of exposure to CAP under laboratory conditions, soil microbial activities were affected, but this effect depended on soil.
40010460	Green biosynthesized N-doped nickel ferrite chitosan-coated nanocomposite for high photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants from wastewater.	Emerging recalcitrant organic pollutants in wastewater impose a global environmental concern that necessitates creation of novel materials or treatment techniques. Various conventional methods were used for removal of organic pollutants, but photocatalytic mechanism is simply cost-effective and green approach. Herein synthesis of N-doped nickel ferrite chitosan-coated nanocomposite (N-NFC) via co-precipitation method using A. indica plant leaves-extract for degradation of Alizarin-dye (AR) and Metribuzin-herbicide (MTB). Powder X-ray-diffraction peaks and electron-microscopic-analysis verified the semi-crystalline nature of composite with 17.99 nm crystalline size, and spherical morphology showed the successful decoration of chitosan around metal oxide. Surface-area-analysis revealed mesoporous characteristics of N-NFC, with increased surface area (107 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>) and pore volume (0.0277 cc/g). Superparamagnetic behaviour of N-NFC composite verified by M-H curve of Vibrating-Sample-Magnetometric analysis with saturation magnetization (M<sub>s</sub>) value 23.54 emu/g. Higher zeta potential (-45.7 mV) and lower band-gap (2.1 eV) values showed stability and high-photocatalytic-activity of composite. N-NFC exhibited maximum removal of AR (96 %) and MTB (92 %), at 10 mgL<sup>-1</sup> with 20 mg catalyst dose at pH ∼7 under 3 h sunlight-irradiation following 1st order-kinetics and Langmuir-adsorption-isotherm model. Radical trapping results suggested that <sup>·</sup>OH > O<sub>2</sub><sup>·</sup> are dominant radical species in photocatalytic degradation of targeted pollutants.
40010249	Herbicide and metabolite mobility in soil profiles under conventional tillage and non-tillage: A two-year comparative field experiment.	A two-year field experiment was conducted to compare the impact of conventional tillage (CT) and non-tillage (NT) on the mobility in two soils (S1 and S2) of the herbicides S-metolachlor (SMOC), foramsulfuron (FORAM), and thiencarbazone-methyl (TCM), and the formation of their main metabolites. Herbicide and metabolite distribution through the soil profiles (0-50 cm) was determined over two maize cycles. After the first application, the mobility of SMOC and TCM was similar under CT conditions, with higher concentrations in S2 + CT topsoil than in S1 + CT due to the higher organic carbon content in S2 and its retention ability, while both herbicides were detected in the entire S1 + CT profile over time. Under NT management, partial interception by the mulch during application reduced the amount of herbicides that initially reached the topsoil, modifying their mobility dynamics. SMOC and TCM properties facilitated their transport through the soil profile, favoured by the irrigation applied shortly after their application. The total SMOC and TCM balance in S1 and S2 profiles revealed possible leaching below 50 cm, especially in soils+CT. However, the simultaneous degradation of SMOC and TCM might also occur on the mulch and/or in soil profiles, as indicated by the continuous detection of two SMOC metabolites (ethane sulfonic acid, SMOC-ESA, and oxanilic acid, SMOC-OA) and one TCM metabolite (thiencarbazone, TCM-MET1) throughout the soil profile in all the treatments assayed. FORAM dissipated faster than SMOC and TCM in all the treatments, with a total balance in all the soil profiles <40 % after 13 days. The high water solubility and polarity of FORAM might have enhanced its leaching, although its degradation to its two main metabolites was also observed in all cases. The mobility dynamics of the three herbicides in the second experimental period were similar for both soils under CT, but differed in soils under NT compared to the first application, with higher interception by the greater amount of mulch on the soil surface in the second year.
40010195	Ionic liquid introduced NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-53(Al) mixed matrix membrane coupled with UPLC-MS/MS for the simultaneous determination of neonicotinoid insecticides and their metabolites in different samples.	In this study, a novel hydroxyl-functionalized imidazolium-based ionic liquid introduced metal-organic framework (OH-IL@NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-53(Al)) was prepared for the extraction of multiple neonicotinoids (NEOs) and their metabolites. The functionalization of ionic liquid obviously enhanced the generate affinity of OH-IL@NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-53(Al) towards NEOs and their metabolites through the pre-designed hydrogen-bonding and cation-π electron donor-acceptor interactions. Adsorption studies of OH-IL@NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-53(Al) showed rapid adsorption rates and excellent adsorption capacities (129.3-204.2 mg/g). Furthermore, OH-IL@NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-53(Al)-based mix matrix membrane (MMM), named OH-IL@NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-53(Al)-MMM, was prepared for dispersive membrane extraction (DME). The supporting of MMM integrated the OH-IL@NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-53(Al) powder, greatly simplifying the extraction procedure. A OH-IL@NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-53(Al)-MMM-based DME-UPLC-MS/MS with good linearity (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 9987), low limits of detection (LODs, 0.001-0.120 ng/mL), and large enrichment factors (75-112) was developed. Based on the designed adsorbent, this work provides an easy and efficient method for the simultaneous analysis of fourteen NEOs and their metabolites in different samples and achieved satisfactory spiked recoveries (70.1-113.6 %).
40010126	Temporal trends of 46 pesticides and 8 transformation products in surface and drinking water in Québec, Canada (2021-2023): Potential higher health risks of transformation products than parent pesticides.	The objective of the present study was to investigate the temporal trends of 46 pesticides and 8 transformation products (TPs) in the surface water of Québec and assess their associated health risks posed through drinking water consumption. Surface and drinking water were sampled twice per week at a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) from 2021 to 2023 (838 days). Pesticide and TPs concentrations were analysed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The data were used to evaluate temporal variations of pesticides and TPs at the source, their removal in DWTPs, their human exposure via drinking water, and the associated health risks. The results showed that peak concentrations of most pesticides and their TPs in surface water occurred in June and July, and some TPs (such as metolachlor ethanesulfonic acid, metolachlor oxanilic acid, and desethylatrazine) exhibited higher concentrations than their parent compounds in surface water. Post conventional treatment analysis revealed no significant decrease in the total concentrations of target pesticides and TPs in drinking water. Notably, 11 pesticides (such as atrazine, mecoprop) and 1 TP (desisopropylatrazine) showed higher concentration in drinking water than in surface water. The hazard index (HI) was up to 18 times higher in summer peak periods than the annual average. Finally, TPs exhibited HI 1.4 to 144 times higher than corresponding parent compounds. This study was the first to assess health risks of TPs versus parent pesticides in drinking water through long-term sampling, highlighting the urgent need for further TPs regulation in drinking water.
40010114	Improving the detectability of low-abundance p-cresol in biological matrices by chemical derivatization and LC-MS/MS determination.	Gut microbiota produces a wide range of microbial metabolites with potential neuroactive properties. Among these, p-cresol, a by-product of tyrosine breakdown, has gained significant attention in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. However, current methods fail to detect p-cresol at trace levels in both the systemic circulation and brain, limiting the study of its role in neuropsychiatric disorders. There, the precise and accurate determination of p-cresol at low picogram levels is an unmet analytical need. To address this gap, we developed a highly-sensitive, validated method for quantifying p-cresol at low picogram levels in urine, plasma, and brain using chemical derivatization and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We found that derivatization with 1,2-dimethylimidazole-5-sulfonyl chloride (5-DMIS-Cl or 5-DMISC) increased up to 40-fold the sensitivity compared to traditional dansyl derivatization. Therefore, a method based on 5-DMISC derivatization and sum of transitions was selected for validation. The method was accurate (recoveries 91-100 %) and precise (RSD <15 %) in all tested matrices, enabling detection down to100 pg/mL for urine, 20 pg/mL for plasma, and 0.04 pg/mg for brain tissue. The method was applied to plasma and brain samples from control and p-cresol-treated mice, revealing significant increases in p-cresol levels in treated animals. For the first time, we successfully quantified p-cresol levels in the brain, demonstrating its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. In summary, this validated method offers a powerful tool for exploring the role of p-cresol -and potentially other phenolic compounds-in the microbiota-gut-brain axis and neuropsychiatric disorders.
40009969	Improving compound identification results by automatically recognizing in-source fragment ions in HRMS with AntDAS: A study on accurate pesticide screening in complex food samples.	Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry has been extensively used for compound identification in an untargeted manner. However, current methods still cannot accurately screen and identify compounds in the presence of in-source fragment ions. Here, we proposed an in-source fragment ion-based strategy to precisely recognize compounds. First, raw data files were analyzed with our newly developed AntDAS-DDA to perform feature detection and annotation. Second, in-source fragment ions from a compound were recognized based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra and the similarity of chromatograms. Last, the MS/MS spectra of each fragment ion were compared with those in an in-house library to benefit compound identification. The performance of the developed strategy was comprehensively investigated using the aforementioned in-house library containing 478 pesticides. Simulated and real samples suggested that compounds were accurately identified. The match factor obtained from the classic method was improved by at least 4.3 times by the developed strategy. The developed strategy may provide a new solution for compound identification in complex food samples.
40009889	Deep eutectic solvents in food contaminants detection: Characteristics, interaction mechanism and application advances from extracting to other roles.	Food safety is crucial for public health, yet it faces growing threats from environmental and anthropogenic pollutants. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as green and efficient alternative solvents for detecting trace pollutants. This review highlights the characteristics of DESs, their mechanisms for extracting target analytes and applications in food analysis. Subsequently, the challenges faced by DESs in the detection of food samples and future development trends are further discussed. DESs can selectively interact with various target analytes (including pesticides, veterinary drugs, food additives, heavy metals, toxins, and other residues) during the food safety testing process by forming hydrogen bond networks. Beyond serving as extraction solvents, DESs can act as adsorbents, eluents, and reaction media, thereby simplifying sample pretreatment and enhancing the detection performance of various contaminants. Overall, as customizable functional solvents, DESs hold great promise for advancing next-generation food analysis methods, though some technical barriers remain to be addressed.
40009775	Binding Affinity Prediction and Pesticide Screening against <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> Using a Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Attention Network-Based Model.	Phytophthora root and stem rot in soybeans results in substantial economic losses worldwide. In this study, a machine learning model based on a heterogeneous interaction graph attention network model was constructed. The PDBbind data set, comprising 13,285 complexes with experimental <i>pK</i><sub>a</sub> or <i>p</i>K<sub>i</sub> values, was utilized to train and evaluate the model, which was subsequently employed to screen candidate compounds against chitin synthase of <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> (<i>Ps</i>Chs1) in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database, comprising 14,249 compounds. High-scoring candidate compounds were docked with <i>Ps</i>Chs1 protein using Discovery Studio, and their interaction energies were evaluated. Molecular dynamic simulations spanning 50 ns were performed using GROMACS to explore the stability of the complexes, trajectory analysis was conducted with root-mean-square deviations, and the hydrogen bonds, radius of gyration, MMPBSA binding free energy, and binding modes were analyzed. MOL011832 and MOL011833 were identified as potential pesticides, both of which were present in the herb <i>Schizonepeta</i> through database retrieval. The inhibitory effects of an ethanol extract of <i>Schizonepeta</i> against <i>P. sojae</i> were subsequently explored and confirmed in biological experiments. Overall, this study proves the feasibility and high efficiency of pesticide discovery using graph neural network-based models.
40009757	Pesticide and hydrocarbon toxicity in fish: effects on <i>Chelon labrosus</i> (Risso, 1827) along the northeastern Sicilian coast (Italy) evaluated by enzymatic biomarkers.	Pesticides intoxication affects aquatic organisms as well as a group of contaminants that are represented by crude oil, petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives. Useful tools for ecotoxicological studies of marine ecosystems are based on biomarker application on bioindicator key fish species. The aim of the present study was to highlight the presence of pesticides and hydrocarbons in a coastal marine environment, the harbour of Capo d'Orlando town (northeastern Sicily, Italy), by using the ecotoxicological biomarker Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymatic activities in the key fish species <i>Chelon labrosus</i>. A reference site was selected. Chemical analysis of water samples was also carried out to analyze and eventually confirm the presence of pesticides in the study area. Results showed significant inhibition in AChE (80%) and BChE (77%) activities in fish from the harbour of Capo d'Orlando compared to the reference site. The esterase inhibition is primarily due to the presence of organophosphorus insecticides and carbamates, that resulted in higher concentrations of contaminants in the water of the harbour of Capo d'Orlando compared to the reference quality standard decree (Ministerial Decree 260, 2010). This study highlighted the contamination by insecticides and most probably by hydrocarbons in fish from the harbour of Capo d'Orlando, which also represents a threat to the human population consuming affected fish.
40009611	LLIN Evaluation in Uganda Project (LLINEUP2) - Effect of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) treated with pyrethroid plus pyriproxyfen vs LLINs treated with pyrethroid plus piperonyl butoxide in Uganda: A cluster-randomised trial.	Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the cornerstone of malaria control, but their effectiveness is threatened by pyrethroid resistance. We embedded a pragmatic, cluster-randomised trial into Uganda's national LLIN distribution campaign in 2020-2021, comparing pyrethroid-piperonyl butoxide (PBO) LLINs to pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs. Target communities surrounding public health facilities (clusters, n=64), covering 32 districts were included. Clusters were randomised 1:1 in blocks of two by district to receive: (1) pyrethroid-PBO LLINs (PermaNet 3.0, n=32) or (2) pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs (Royal Guard, n=32). LLINs were delivered from 7 November 2020 to 26 March 2021. Malaria surveillance data were collected from health facilities from 1 November 2019 until 31 March 2023. Cluster-level estimates of malaria incidence in residents of all ages (primary outcome) were generated from enhanced health facility surveillance data. Cross-sectional community surveys were conducted in randomly selected households (at least 50 per cluster) at 12-months (24 November 2021 to 1 April 2022) and 24-months (23 November 2022 to 21 March 2023) post-LLIN distribution. Overall, 186,364 clinical malaria episodes were diagnosed in cluster residents during 398,931 person-years of follow-up. At 24-months, malaria incidence was lower than baseline in both arms (pyrethroid-PBO: 465 vs 676 episodes per 1000 person-years; pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen: 469 vs 674 episodes per 1000 person-years); but there was no evidence of a difference between the arms (incidence rate ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.22, p=0.47). Two years post-distribution, ownership of at least one LLIN for every two household residents was low in both arms (41.1% pyrethroid-PBO vs 38.6% pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen). Parasite prevalence in children aged 2-10 years was no different between the arms in either survey (24-months: 26.1% pyrethroid-PBO; 29.5% pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen; odds ratio 1.29 [95% CI: 0.81-2.05], p=0.29). The effectiveness of pyrethroid-PBO LLINs and pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen LLINs was no different in Uganda, but two years after mass distribution, LLIN coverage was inadequate. Trial registration: NCT04566510. Registered 28 September 2020, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04566510.
40009445	Photobiocatalytic Reaction: From Single Component to Triple Component.	Despite remarkable advances in photoenzymatic methodologies, the development of photoenzymatic multicomponent reactions remains a significant challenge. In this Highlight, we showcase a recent breakthrough by Prof. Xiaoqiang Huang and co-workers, who achieved enantioselective triple component radical sorting via visible light-induced biocatalysis under mild conditions. This innovative approach opens new avenues for the synthesis of complex molecules with high precision and efficiency, marking a remarkable advance in the field of enzymatic photocatalysis.
40008849	Anionic Stereogenic-at-Cobalt(III) Complex-Enabled Asymmetric Oxidation of <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-Dialkyl Sulfenamides.	An asymmetric oxidation of <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dialkyl sulfenamides is exhibited by using anionic stereogenic-at-cobalt(III) complexes as catalysts. This protocol provides an alternative approach to access a diverse set of chiral tertiary sulfinamides with high enantioselectivities (24 examples, up to 94:6 e.r.). Additionally, control experiments suggest that this protocol could be accomplished through a chiral cationic S(IV) intermediate.
40008719	Factors associated with recurrence in operable breast cancer patients undergoing surgery as the sole treatment modality.	Approximately 10% of breast cancer patients with localized operable disease experience recurrence. This study aimed to evaluate patients with early-stage breast cancer (TNM I and II) who underwent surgery without the need for neoadjuvant therapy.
40007612	Comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms conferring resistance to phenamacril in the <i>Fusarium</i> species.	The filamentous fungal genus <i>Fusarium</i> contains many species that cause catastrophic diseases in fruits, cereal, and vegetables. These diseases cause substantial losses in yield and contaminate affected crops with toxins. This causes huge losses in the agricultural sector and threatens human and animal health. The most efficient approach to control the <i>Fusarium</i> spp. is fungicide application. Phenamacril is a site-specific fungicide that exerts its antifungal effect on sensitive <i>Fusarium</i> spp. It is a new fungicide developed that targets <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> by inhibiting myosin-5, an important protein in fungal growth and disease development. Because of its remarkable specificity, the new fungicide phenamacril is regarded as environmentally benign. However, many research findings have reported the emergence of the resistance of <i>Fusarium</i> spp. to phenamacril in both the field and laboratory. This article comprehensively analyzes the mechanisms underlying <i>Fusarium</i> spp. resistance to phenamacril. We examine the molecular, genetic, and environmental factors contributing to this resistance. We emphasize the importance of continued research and integrating different approaches to monitoring and managing drug-resistant <i>Fusarium</i> spp. populations. Integrating current inventions to inform strategies for sustainable disease control practices, and increase plant health, and yield will contribute to ongoing global efforts to achieve food and nutritional sustainability for the world's rapidly growing population while ensuring the effectiveness of the fungicidal product.
40007571	Enhanced electrochemical sensing of methyl parathion using AgNPs@IL/GO nanocomposites in aqueous matrices.	Methyl parathion (MP) is a widely used pesticide; it is recognized as being toxic to both target and non-target species, posing serious risks to environmental and human health. Monitoring and controlling MP residues is thus essential, necessitating the development of innovative sensors that are highly sensitive, selective, and reproducible. In the present study, an efficient electrochemical MP sensor is proposed based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in conjunction with graphene oxide/ionic liquid (GO/IL) on screen printed electrodes (AgNPs@GO/IL@SPCE). The AgNPs were synthesized <i>via</i> a cost-effective wet-chemical process and characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The modified electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The active surface area and charge transfer were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. The modified electrodes' electrocatalytic performance towards the reduction of MP was investigated by CV, complemented by semiempirical quantum chemistry calculations to elucidate the interaction and the electrochemical reduction mechanism of MP. The sensor demonstrates a remarkable limit of detection of 0.009 μmol L<sup>-1</sup> within a linear range of 0.025 to 200 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>. It has an excellent analytical performance in terms of selectivity, reproducibility, and long-term stability over 60 days. The designed sensor was effectively used to inspect MP in groundwater and surface water samples, with recovery values ranging from 95.60% to 99.68%.
40007473	TYMIRIUM® technology: the discovery of Cyclobutrifluram.	Syngenta responded to significant agricultural losses caused by plant-parasitic nematodes by initiating a next-generation nematicide discovery program. This effort led to the development of TYMIRIUM® technology, a nematicide and fungicide solution containing Cyclobutrifluram as its active ingredient. In 2022, this innovative solution received its first registration. Cyclobutrifluram, a chiral phenyl-cyclobutyl-pyridineamide, demonstrates wide-ranging effectiveness against all economically important plant parasitic nematodes and several soil-borne diseases, particularly those caused by Fusarium species. The discovery of this molecule involved hit the identification, lead exploration, and optimization stages, which made use of various methods such as phenotypic nematicide screening platforms, targeted screening libraries, rapid target identification through biochemical and genetic approaches, in vitro assays for structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, and homology models for structure-based design. This multi-disciplinary approach led to the successful identification of Cyclobutrifluram as the key component in TYMIRIUM® technology. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.
40007469	Plant Species Better Adapted to Climate Change Need Agricultural Extensification to Persist.	Agricultural intensification and climate change have led to well-known vegetation shifts in agricultural landscapes. However, concomitant plant functional changes in agroecosystems, especially at large scales, have been seldom characterised. Here, we used a standardised yearly monitoring of > 400 agricultural field margins in France to assess the temporal response of vegetation diversity and functional traits to variations in climate and intensity of agricultural practices (herbicides, fertilisation and mowing) between 2013 and 2021. We observed clear temporal trends of increasing warming and aridity, but trends towards agricultural extensification were weak or nonsignificant. Our results showed functional changes in plant communities over time, driven mostly by climate change and suggested selective forces opposing climate change to agricultural intensification. This translated as a temporal decline of competitive and ruderal species in favour of stress-tolerant species, putting plant communities in agroecosystems in a difficult position to escape both climate and agricultural pressures at the same time.
40007373	Comparative metabolomics elucidates the early defense response mechanisms to Plutella xylostella infestation in Brassica napus.	Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth; DBM) is a significant pest of Brassica crops, causing billions of dollars in annual global damage and developing resistance to many insecticides. Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of infestations by influencing the moth's reproduction and expanding its range, leading to increased crop losses. In this study, we examined the early metabolomic responses of four Brassica napus accessions to DBM infestation, focusing on identifying the metabolic basis of tolerance. Phenotypic analysis showed that R4220 and R4415 were highly susceptible, with remaining leaf areas of 27 and 38%, respectively, while the tolerant accessions R4637 and R5064 retained 85 and 91% of their leaf area post-infestation. Metabolomic profiling revealed a distinct separation between tolerant and sensitive accessions under both control and infested conditions. Notably, tolerant accessions exhibited differential accumulation of metabolites, with abundant metabolites belonging to lipid and lipid-like molecules, organic acids and derivatives, and benzenoids. Additionally, 31 metabolites were found to be consistently expressed at higher levels in tolerant accessions as compared to sensitive ones, notably tridecanedioic acid, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine and benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid. Furthermore, KEGG analysis revealed that pathways such as phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and ABC transporters were enriched, indicating their critical roles in the defense mechanisms. This comprehensive analysis of metabolomic alterations provides valuable insights into the biochemical pathways underpinning insect tolerance in rapeseed, potentially guiding the development of more resilient cultivars and leading a pathway to improve crop farming for sustainable agriculture.
40007229	Harnessing Fungal Bioagents Rich in Volatile Metabolites for Sustainable Crop Protection: A Critical Review.	Pests and diseases have a significant impact on crop health and yields, posing a serious threat to global agriculture. Effective management strategies, such as integrated pest management (IPM), including crop rotation, use of synthetic pesticides, biological control, and resistant/tolerant crop varieties, are essential to mitigate these risks and ensure sustainable agricultural practices. Fungal bioagents play an important role in managing phytopathogens and insect pests by acting as biological agents. They promote healthy plant growth by enhancing the uptake of nutrients and combating systemic resistance in plants. Furthermore, fungal bioagents are environmentally friendly, reducing application of fungicides and insecticides and minimizing their negative impact on the crops and environment. Their use in IPM promotes sustainable agriculture and ensures high-quality crops while maintaining soil health and microbial biodiversity. These fungal bioagents are rich sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which play an important role in biological communication during interaction with insect pests and phytopathogens. In pest management, VOC production by beneficial fungi is accountable for their efficacy against pests and pathogens. Thus, this review discusses the important fungal bioagents producing VOCs, extraction methods of VOC, and the use of VOC-producing fungi in pest and disease management, knowledge gaps, and future research areas.
40007201	Harnessing Microbial Consortia for Sustainable Management of Corm Rot of Saffron.	Saffron (Crocus Sativus L.) is a highly prized spice crop renowned for its significant culinary and therapeutic applications, largely attributed to its bioactive constituents such as crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal. Despite its production is severely threatened by corm rot, particularly caused by the pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum, which leads to substantial yield losses in major saffron-producing regions. This review highlights the promising role of microbial consortia as an eco-friendly and sustainable strategy for effectively managing corm rot disease. The presence of diverse microbial communities can improve defense mechanisms of a plant against pathogens and support its overall growth and productivity. The mechanisms by which these microbial interactions occur, including nutrient competition, biofilm formation, and the activation of systemic resistance, contribute to their combined efficacy in inhibiting fungal pathogens. The necessity for innovative microbial strategies that harness the combined benefits of diverse microorganisms to mitigate corm rot and improve saffron cultivation sustainably. As sustainable agricultural practices increasingly gain prominence, the development and application of tailored microbial consortia gave a promising alternative to chemical fungicides, ensuring both economic viability and ecological balance in saffron production.
40007158	A transposon-based cargo system mediates gene trafficking and creates ultra-clean transgenic plants after stable transformation.	Genetically modified crops have profound impacts on cost savings and environmental friendliness conferred by new traits, such as resistance to insects and herbicides. Selectable marker genes are essential for screening transformed cells, but they are undesirable in the final product due to the risks of horizontal gene transfer and extensive safety assessment requirements. Generating marker- and backbone-free lines can enhance the public acceptance of transgenic crops. Here, we established a transposon-mediated ultra-clean selectable transformant (TRUST) system for generating marker- and backbone-free transformants in a visibly controllable manner, facilitated by the integration of transposon elements, fluorescence proteins, and the anthocyanin biosynthesis gene. This system creates ultra-clean transgenic events that retain only the expression cassette of the gene of interest with an average probability of 15.5%. Additionally, long-read whole-genome sequencing confirmed the integrity of the expression cassette boundaries. The TRUST system is not only a powerful method for producing backbone-free transgenic plants but also increases the number of transgenic events originating from one starting event, thereby potentially leading to advances in the genetic engineering of recalcitrant crop varieties.
40007101	Design, Synthesis, and Antifungal Activity of Melatonin Derivatives Containing a (Thio)Semicarbazide Group.	Melatonin is a natural hormone that has functions such as circadian rhythm regulation, neuroregulation and cardiac protection, as well as antifungal activity. In this study, two series of melatonin derivatives containing a semicarbazide or a thiosemicarbazide group were designed and synthesized. The antifungal screening results indicated that compound III-9 exhibited a broad antifungal spectrum against six phytopathogenic fungi at 50 µg/mL, with over 60% growth inhibition, and this is highlighted by its inhibition rates of 80.8% and 87.2% against Botrytis cinerea and Rhioctorzia solani, respectively, which was superior to the commercial fungicide Osthole. It also showed moderate antifungal activity in vivo against Cucumber botrytis cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Phytophthora capsica at 200 µg/mL. And the scanning electron microscope (SEM), molecular docking, and enzymatic activity results provided insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the antifungal activity of these derivatives, which might target succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Study of structure-activity relationships (SAR) and pesticide-likeness prediction offered valuable guidance for the future structural optimization of melatonin derivatives.
40006975	Avermectins Inhibit Replication of Parvovirus B19 by Disrupting the Interaction Between Importin α and Non-Structural Protein 1.	Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a major human pathogen in which the ssDNA genome is replicated within the nucleus of infected human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) through a process involving both cellular and viral proteins, including the non-structural protein (NS)1. We previously characterized the interaction between NS1 classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS: GACHAKKPRIT-182) and host cell importin (IMP)α and proposed it as a potential target for antiviral drug development. Here, we further extend on such findings. First, we demonstrate that NS1 nuclear localization is required for viral production since introducing the K177T substitution in a cloned, infectious viral genome resulted in a non-viable virus. Secondly, we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug ivermectin (IVM), known to inhibit the IMPα/β dependent nuclear import pathway, could impair the NS1-NLS:IMPα interaction and suppress viral replication in UT7/EpoS1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. We also show that a panel of structurally related avermectins (AVMs) can dissociate the NS1-NLS:IMPα complex with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in the nanomolar range. Among them, Eprinomectin emerged as the most selective inhibitor of B19V replication, with a selectivity index of c. 5.0. However, when tested in EPCs generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which constitute a cellular population close to the natural target cells in bone marrow, the inhibitory effect of IVM and Eprinomectin was demonstrated to a lesser extent, and both compounds exhibited high toxicity, thus highlighting the need for more specific inhibitors of the NS1-NLS:IMPα interaction.
40006898	Baculovirus Genetic Diversity and Population Structure.	Baculoviruses can naturally regulate lepidopteran populations and are used as biological insecticides. The genetic diversity of these viruses affects their survival and efficacy in pest control. For nucleopolyhedroviruses, occlusion-derived virions and the occlusion body facilitate the transmission of groups of genomes, whereas this is not the case for granuloviruses. We review the evidence for baculovirus genetic diversity in the environment, in the host insect, and in occlusion bodies and virions. Coinfection allows defective genotypes to persist through complementation and results in the pseudotyping of virus progeny that can influence their transmissibility and insecticidal properties. Genetic diversity has marked implications for the development of pest resistance to virus insecticides. We conclude that future research is warranted on the physical segregation of genomes during virus replication and on the independent action of virions during infection. We also identify opportunities for studies on the transmission of genetic diversity and host resistance to viruses.
40006833	Effect of Different Temperatures on Herbicide Efficacy for the Management of the Invasive Weed <i>Solanum rostratum</i> Dunal (Family: Solanaceae).	<i>Solanum rostratum</i> Dunal, an invasive weed first recorded in Israel in the 1950s, undergoes multiple germination waves from early spring to late summer. Recently, its distribution has significantly expanded, with new populations reported throughout the country. This study assessed the efficacy of various herbicides for controlling <i>S. rostratum</i> populations under two distinct temperature regimes, focusing on temperature-dependent variations in herbicide performance. The results demonstrated that fluroxypyr and tembotrione consistently achieved high levels of control across all temperature conditions. Conversely, oxyfluorfen exhibited low performance under elevated temperatures and showed greater population-specific variability, while metribuzin proved more effective at higher temperatures across all <i>S. rostratum</i> populations. These findings emphasize the pivotal role of post-application temperature in influencing herbicide efficacy and underscore the importance of a precise application timing to optimize the control outcomes. Temperature-optimized herbicide strategies could play a critical role in limiting the spread and establishment of <i>S. rostratum</i> in agricultural systems, contributing to a sustainable and effective weed management.
40006831	Stress Increases Ecological Risk of Glufosinate-Resistant Transgene Located on Alien Chromosomes in Hybrids Between Transgenic <i>Brassica napus</i> and Wild <i>Brassica juncea</i>.	When glufosinate-resistant transgenic <i>Brassica napus</i> (transgene <i>PAT</i> located on C chromosome) were backcrossed with wild <i>Brassica juncea</i>, 50% of the progeny expressed <i>PAT</i> under favourable conditions. However, exposure to stress (drought, salt, flooding, and intraspecific competition) increased the proportion of plants expressing the <i>PAT</i> gene (r-e plants) by approximately 20% compared to those under unstressed conditions. In the self-pollinated progeny of the stressed plants, the proportion of r-e plants increased by a nearly 30% compared to that of the unstressed plants. Composite fitness was comparable between plants developed under drought stress at the seedling stage and those grown under favourable conditions. Abscisic acid (ABA) content and expression of the Repressor of Silencing 1 (<i>ROS1</i>) in leaves increased significantly after stress treatment in the progeny, with r-e plants exhibiting higher levels. Exogenous ABA treatment significantly up-regulated <i>ROS1</i> expression in progeny leaves, and the ABA treatment of seeds increased the survival of progeny exposed to glufosinate by 15%. Results suggest that increasing ABA under stress may enhance the demethylation of <i>PAT</i>'s promoter by promoting <i>ROS1</i> expression, thereby inhibiting transgene silencing of <i>PAT</i>, indicating that transgene located on the C chromosome of transgenic <i>B. napus</i> may pose a higher risk of gene flow to wild <i>B. juncea</i> under stress, especially drought stress.
40006823	False Seedbed and Stale Seedbed Against Important Broadleaf Weeds: A Case Study and a Step Closer to Agroecology.	Wheat production can be reduced due to competition from weeds, with farmers relying almost exclusively on chemical solutions. However, there are alternative farming practices available. Therefore, in a field trial in Greece, we assessed the efficacy of false and stale seedbed against important broadleaf weed species and their impact on grain yield parameters. Our study determined that false seedbed resulted in a decrease in the density and biomass of broadleaf weed species like catchweed bedstraw (<i>Galium aparine</i> L.) up to 75% and 69% compared with the untreated control (normal seedbed preparation), respectively. The efficacy of false seedbed was higher when combined with post-emergence chemical control. Stale seedbed also resulted in adequate weed control, with a biomass reduction of up to 81%, and grain yield increased by 30% compared with the normal seedbed preparation without any herbicide use. Our results highlight the differences in the response between the weed species and also emphasize the potential of adding an alternative farming practice (like false and stale seedbed) as part of an integrated farming strategy for a sustainable and agroecological crop and weed management. In order to validate the trends observed in this case study, further field-to-field or year-to-year replication is required.
40006814	Memory Induced by Recurrent Drought Stress in Chirca (<i>Acanthostyles buniifolius</i>).	To thrive as a successful weed in natural pastures, a plant must have not only highly competitive ability, but also the resilience to endure environmental stress and rapidly reclaim space once those stressors diminish and the other non-stress-tolerant plants die. <i>Acanthostyles buniifolius</i> [(Hook. ex Hook. & Arn.) R.M.King & H.Rob.], known as chirca, is a widely spread weed in South American natural pastures. It is known for its remarkable ability to withstand environmental stress and flourish in environments with prevalent stressors. The study evaluated the memory effect of water stress (drought) in chirca plants. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in a randomized block design with three replications. Treatments included Control = control plants without water deficit kept at 100% of the soil water-holding capacity (WHC); Primed plants = plants that were primed with water stress at 141 days after emergence (DAE) and received recurrent stress at 164 DAE; Naïve plants: plants that only experienced water stress at 164 DAE. To reach water stress, plants were not watered until the soil reached 15% of the soil's WHC, which occurred ten days after water suppression in the priming stress and nine days after water suppression in the second stress. During periods without restriction, the pots were watered daily at 100% of the WHC. Primed plants exposed to water deficit better-maintained water status compared to the naïve plants; glycine betaine is an important defense mechanism against water deficit in chirca; naïve plants have a higher concentration of proline than plants under recurrent stress, demonstrating the greater need for protection against oxidative damage and needs greater osmotic regulation. Recurrent water deficits can prepare chirca plants for future drought events. These results show that chirca is a very adaptative weed and may become a greater threat to pastures in South America due to climate change, especially if drought becomes more frequent and severe.
40006787	Multifunctional Roles and Ecological Implications of Nano-Enabled Technologies in <i>Oryza sativa</i> Production Systems: A Comprehensive Review.	Micro-nanomaterials have garnered significant attention in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) cultivation due to their unique physicochemical properties. This study reviews the multifunctional applications of micro-nanomaterials in enhancing rice resilience, promoting nutrient uptake, improving photosynthetic efficiency, and increasing the utilization rates of fertilizers and pesticides. Using keyword and clustering analyses, this review identifies key research hotspots and emerging trends in the field, including heavy metal stress, nanoplastic pollution, and biochar applications. While early studies predominantly focused on the synthesis and characterization of these materials, recent research has shifted towards evaluating their comprehensive ecological impacts on rice production systems. Despite the promising potential of micro-nanomaterials in improving rice yield and quality while supporting sustainable agriculture, concerns about their long-term accumulation in ecosystems and potential toxicity remain unresolved. Future research should prioritize the development of cost-effective, efficient, and environmentally friendly micro-nanomaterials and establish standardized frameworks for ecological risk assessments to facilitate their large-scale agricultural application. This study provides theoretical insights and practical references for advancing micro-nanotechnology in global food security and sustainable agriculture.
40006784	A New Pro-197-Ile Mutation in <i>Amaranthus palmeri</i> Associated with Acetolactate Synthase-Inhibiting Herbicide Resistance.	Palmer amaranth (<i>Amaranthus palmeri</i> S. Watson), native to North America, is one of the most prominent invasive weed species on agricultural land. Acetolactate synthase (ALS)-resistant <i>A. palmeri</i> (<i>Amaranthus palmeri</i>) is widespread, while the research focus on resistance pattern and molecular basis of <i>A. palmeri</i> to imazethapyr is seldom documented in China. An <i>A. palmeri</i> population that survived the recommended rate of imazethapyr was collected in Shandong Province, China. The resistant mechanism and pattern of <i>A. palmeri</i> to imazethapyr was investigated. Dose-response assay showed that the resistant (R) population displayed a high resistance level (292.5-fold) to imazethapyr compared with the susceptible (S) population. Sequence analysis of the <i>ALS</i> gene revealed that nucleotide mutations resulted in three resistance-conferring amino acid substitutions, Pro-197-Ile, Trp-574-Leu, and Ser-653-Asp, in the individual plants of the R population. An in vitro enzyme assay indicated that the ALS was relatively unsusceptible to imazethapyr in the R population, showing a resistance index of 88.6-fold. <i>ALS</i> gene expression and copy number did not confer resistance to imazethapyr in the R population. Pro-197-Ile is the first reported amino acid substitution conferring ALS resistance to <i>A. palmeri</i>. This is the first case of an imazethapyr-resistant <i>A. palmeri</i> biotype in China.
40006783	WRKY36-PIL15 Transcription Factor Complex Negatively Regulates Sheath Blight Resistance and Seed Development in Rice.	Sheath blight (ShB) causes severe yield loss in rice. Previously, we demonstrated that the <i>sugar will eventually be exported and the transporter 11</i> (<i>SWEET11</i>) mutation significantly improved rice resistance to ShB, but it caused severe defects in seed development. The present study found that WRKY36 and PIL15 directly activate <i>SWEET11</i> to negatively regulate ShB. Interestingly, WRKY36 interacted with PIL15, WRKY36 and PIL15 directly activates <i>miR530</i> to negatively regulate seed development. WRKY36 interacted with a key BR signaling transcription factor WRKY53. AOS2 is an effector protein from <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> (<i>R. solani</i>) that interacts with WRKY53. Interestingly, AOS2 also interacts with WRKY36 and PIL15 to activate <i>SWEET11</i> for sugar nutrition for <i>R. solani</i>. These data collectively suggest that WRKY36-PIL15 negatively regulates ShB resistance and seed development via the activation of <i>SWEET11</i> and <i>miR530</i>, respectively. In addition, WRKY36 and PIL15 are the partners of the effector protein AOS2 by which <i>R. solani</i> hijacks sugar nutrition from rice.
40006774	Rapid Resistance Detection of <i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i> to Fomesafen via Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP).	<i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i> is a highly invasive annual broadleaf weed in soybean fields, significantly reducing soybean yield and quality. Diphenyl ether herbicides, particularly fomesafen, are extensively applied to control <i>A. retroflexus</i>. Fomesafen resistance of <i>A. retroflexus</i> is emerging in Northeast China, and rapid resistance detection is urgent for managing these resistant weeds. An Arg-128-Gly mutation in the <i>ppo2</i> gene of <i>A. retroflexus</i> has been shown to confer fomesafen resistance. In current study, we developed a rapid detection method based on Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) technology to detect the Arg-128-Gly mutation in the <i>ppo2</i> gene of <i>A. retroflexus</i>. Initially, we developed this KASP detection method using cDNA as the template; however, the entire process requires significant costs and considerable operational time. To mitigate these expenses and simplify the workflow, we subsequently optimized this KASP rapid detection method by utilizing genomic DNA as the template. This new resistance detection technique directly utilizes <i>A. retroflexus</i> genomic DNA as the template, and, by adding specific labelled primers, probes, and enzymes, it can determine whether the <i>ppo2</i> gene harbors an Arg-128-Gly mutation, thereby rapidly identifying fomesafen resistance in <i>A. retroflexus</i>. Furthermore, we compared the detection efficiency of the new KASP assay, whole plant dose-response assay, and DNA sequencing, all of which produced consistent outcomes, supporting the accuracy and reliability of the KASP rapid detection method. Collectively, we established a rapid resistance detection method based on KASP technology, which is of high reliability and time-saving, and will significantly advance precise management of resistant weeds.
40006770	Insecticidal Activity of Lectin Preparations from <i>Moringa oleifera</i> Lam. (Moringaceae) Seeds Against <i>Alphitobius diaperinus</i> (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae).	The lesser mealworm, <i>Alphitobius diaperinus</i>, is a widespread pest in poultry farming, causing economic losses and facilitating the spread of pathogens. Current control methods rely heavily on synthetic insecticides, which raise environmental concerns and contribute to resistance. This study investigated the insecticidal potential of <i>Moringa oleifera</i> seed preparations, including an aqueous extract (AE), a protein-enriched fraction (PF), and an isolated lectin (WSMoL), against <i>A. diaperinus</i>. Contact assays demonstrated that AE and PF reduced adult survival by up to 90% and 100%, respectively, while WSMoL was effective only against larvae, causing 48% mortality. Ingestion assays showed that AE and PF reduced adult survival by 60% and 30%, respectively; impaired diet utilization; and caused significant weight loss. WSMoL exhibited antinutritional effects, including a 94% reduction in trypsin-like activity, but did not cause lethality, although it may impair long-term survival. Midgut histological analysis revealed epithelial disorganization, vacuolization, and nuclear condensation in the treated insects. These findings suggest that <i>M. oleifera</i> seed preparations are promising candidates for sustainable pest control, offering both lethal and sublethal effects on <i>A. diaperinus</i>. Future research should focus on the development of formulations and long-term impact assessments on pest populations and non-target organisms, paving the way for eco-friendly alternatives in integrated pest management.
40006577	Thymoquinone-Loaded Chitosan Nanoparticles Combat Testicular Aging and Oxidative Stress Through SIRT1/FOXO3a Activation: An In Vivo and In Vitro Study.	<b>Background:</b> Aging is a complex biological process characterized by the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage over time, often driven by oxidative stress. This oxidative stress is particularly detrimental to the testes, where it causes degeneration, reduced testosterone levels, and compromised fertility. D-galactose (D-gal) is commonly used to model aging as it induces oxidative stress, mimicking age-related cellular and molecular damage. Testicular aging is of significant concern due to its implications for reproductive health and hormonal balance. This research examines the protection by thymoquinone (TQ) or thymoquinone-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (NCPs) against D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging in rat testes, focusing on biochemical, histological, and molecular changes. Aging, which is driven largely by oxidative stress, leads to significant testicular degeneration, reducing fertility. D-gal is widely used to model aging due to its ability to induce oxidative stress and mimic age-related damage. TQ, a bioactive ingredient of <i>Nigella sativa</i>, has earned a reputation for its anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant characteristics, but its therapeutic application is limited by its poor bioavailability. <b>Methods</b>: Thymoquinone was loaded into chitosan nanoparticles (NCPs) to enhance its efficacy, and this was hypothesized to improve its stability and bioavailability. Four groups of male Wistar rats participated in the study: one for the control, one for D-gal, one for D-gal + TQ, and the last one for D-gal + NCP. <b>Results</b>: The results exhibited that D-gal substantially increased oxidative injury, reduced testosterone levels, and caused testicular damage. Treatment with TQ and NCPs significantly reduced oxidative stress, improved antioxidant enzyme levels, and restored testosterone levels, with NCPs showing a stronger protective effect than TQ alone. A histological analysis confirmed that NCPs better preserved testicular structure and function. Additionally, the NCP treatment upregulated the expression of key genes of oxidative stress resistance, mitochondrial function, and reproductive health, including SIRT1, FOXO3a, and TERT. <b>Conclusions:</b> The findings suggest that NCPs offer enhanced protection against aging-related testicular damage compared with TQ alone, which is likely due to the improved bioavailability and stability provided by the nanoparticle delivery system. This research emphasizes the potential of NCPs as a more effective therapeutic strategy for mitigating oxidative stress and age-related reproductive dysfunction. Future research should further explore the mechanisms underlying these protective effects.
40006523	Pesticides' Cornea Permeability-How Serious Is This Problem?	<b>Background:</b> A total of 348 pesticides from different chemical families (carbamates, organochlorines organophosphorus compounds, pyrethroids, triazines and miscellaneous) were investigated in the context of their cornea permeability and potential to cause eye corrosion. <b>Methods:</b> Multivariate models of cornea permeability based on compounds whose cornea permeability has been determined experimentally were proposed. The models, applicable to compounds across a relatively broad lipophilicity range (e.g., pesticides with octanol-water partition coefficient log <b><i>P</i></b> up to ca. 8), assume a reverse-parabolic relationship between cornea permeability and lipophilicity, expressed as <b><i>XLOGP3</i></b>; other main descriptors present in the models are log <b><i>D</i></b> at pH 7.4 and polar surface area (<b><i>PSA</i></b>). <b>Results:</b> It appears that the trans-corneal transport of all studied pesticides is possible to some degree; however, it is more difficult for the majority of highly lipophilic pesticides from the organochlorine and pyrethroid families. The same set of 348 pesticides was also evaluated for their eye-corrosive potential using novel artificial neural network models involving simple physico-chemical properties of the compounds (lipophilicity, aqueous solubility, polar surface area, H-bond donor and acceptor count and the count of atoms such as N, NH, O, P, S and halogens). <b>Conclusions:</b> It was concluded that eye corrosion is an issue, especially among the pesticides from organochlorine and organophosphorus families.
40006164	Adsorption of Organic Pollutants from Wastewater Using Chitosan-Based Adsorbents.	Among the naturally occurring polysaccharides, chitosan is the second-most abundant polysaccharide. It is obtained from chitin through a process known as deacetylation. It is biodegradable, biocompatible, and non-toxic, which made it suitable for various environmental applications. In the present review, the structure, properties, and characteristics of chitosan were discussed. In addition, the modified forms of chitosan (including cross-linked, nanoparticles, functionalized, and grafted forms of chitosan) were enumerated. The applications of these modified forms of chitosan in the adsorption of organic pollutants (such as antibiotics, dyes, pesticides, microplastics, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, parabens, and polychlorobiphenyls) are comprehensively reviewed. Furthermore, the mechanism of adsorption, adsorption isotherm (Langmuir and Freundlich), and the kinetic models are highlighted. Finally, the economic viability assessment and environmental impact of processing tons of shrimp shells into chitosan annually were discussed.
40006135	Chitosan-Lemongrass Essential Oil on Paperboard for Active Food Packaging Applications.	An active film-forming solution of chitosan and lemongrass essential oil was applied as a coating on paperboard, forming an alternative and sustainable packaging material for food applications. The active paper-film systems were characterized by color parameters, thermogravimetric analyses, contact angles, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, mechanical properties, and cytotoxicity. The active coated paperboard was homogeneous and yellowish in appearance. The tensile strength (transverse and longitudinal directions) was directly influenced by increasing the number of layers of the chitosan-lemongrass active coating. The oil concentration significantly affected the Taber stiffness (transverse direction). The active coatings with higher concentrations of lemongrass essential oil altered the thermal stability of the coated paperboard. The contact angle values were characteristic of hydrophobic materials. The coated systems presented three characteristic peaks in the X-ray diffraction analysis-2θ = 16.5°, 22.9°, and 29.8°-and an amorphous halo at 18.9°. The cytotoxicity analysis of the active material (1:40:5) indicated potential reductions in the lemongrass essential oil content to maintain cell viability while ensuring insecticidal efficacy, supporting its safe use as food-contact active packaging. In this way, the active packaging system based on a chitosan coating containing lemongrass essential oil on paperboard could be a type of efficient active material packaging which is safe in contact with food and sustainable for the environment.
40006086	The Therapeutic Potential of Spirooxindoles in Cancer: A Focus on p53-MDM2 Modulation.	The p53, often referred to as the "guardian of the genome", is a well-established tumor-suppressor protein that plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle, DNA repair, differentiation, and apoptosis, with its activity primarily modulated by the MDM2 protein (murine double minute 2, also known as HDM2 in humans). Disrupting the protein-protein interaction between p53 and MDM2 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for developing anticancer agents. Recent studies have shown that several spirooxindole-containing compounds exhibit significant antitumor properties, primarily by inhibiting the p53-MDM2 interaction. This review provides an overview of structure-based spirooxindoles that could have therapeutic potential. It highlights findings from the past decade concerning their antiproliferative properties and implications for interfering with the p53-MDM2 interaction. The discussion includes various analogs of spirooxindoles as promising candidates for optimizing leads in drug discovery programs aimed at developing novel and clinically effective agents.
40005918	A Review of Biological and Sustainable Management Approaches for <i>Alphitobius diaperinus</i>, a Major Pest in Poultry Facilities.	The lesser mealworm (<i>Alphitobius diaperinus</i>) is a significant pest in poultry facilities, transmitting pathogens such as <i>Salmonella</i> and causing structural damage in poultry operations. Challenges such as insecticide resistance and environmental concerns associated with the widespread use of traditional insecticides underscore the need for sustainable alternatives. This review examines biological and sustainable management strategies for managing the lesser mealworm, including entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria, nematodes, plant essential oils-extracts, pheromones, and diatomaceous earth. These eco-friendly approaches highlight fungi and nematodes for their effectiveness in larval control and essential oils for their insecticidal and repellent properties. The application of pheromones and diatomaceous earth further complements other methods within integrated pest management (IPM) systems. Integrating these biological tools into IPM offers a sustainable and effective solution for reducing <i>A. diaperinus</i> populations, addressing both health and environmental concerns.
40005804	Algae and Cyanobacteria Fatty Acids and Bioactive Metabolites: Natural Antifungal Alternative Against <i>Fusarium</i> sp.	Fungal diseases caused by <i>Fusarium</i> spp. significantly threaten food security and sustainable agriculture. One of the traditional strategies for eradicating <i>Fusarium</i> spp. incidents is the use of chemical and synthetic fungicides. The excessive use of these products generates environmental damage and has negative effects on crop yield. It puts plants in stressful conditions, kills the natural soil microbiome, and makes phytopathogenic fungi resistant. Finally, it also causes health problems in farmers. This drives the search for and selection of natural alternatives, such as bio-fungicides. Among natural products, algae and cyanobacteria are promising sources of antifungal bio-compounds. These organisms can synthesize different bioactive molecules, such as fatty acids, phenolic acids, and some volatile organic compounds with antifungal activity, which can damage the fungal cell membrane that surrounds the hyphae and spores, either by solubilization or by making them porous and disrupted. Research in this area is still developing, but significant progress has been made in the identification of the compounds with potential for controlling this important pathogen. Therefore, this review focuses on the knowledge about the mechanisms of action of the fatty acids from macroalgae, microalgae, and cyanobacteria as principal biomolecules with antifungal activity, as well as on the benefits and challenges of applying these natural metabolites against <i>Fusarium</i> spp. to achieve sustainable agriculture.
40005793	Uncovering the Host Range-Lifestyle Relationship in the Endophytic and Anthracnose Pathogenic Genus <i>Colletotrichum</i>.	<i>Colletotrichum</i> includes agriculturally and scientifically important pathogens that infect numerous plants. They can also adopt an endophytic lifestyle, refraining from causing disease and/or even promoting plant growth when inoculated on a non-susceptible host. In this manner, the host range of a <i>Colletotrichum</i> fungus can shift, depending on whether it exhibits endophytic or pathogenic lifestyles. Some fungi, such as <i>Colletotrichum tofieldiae</i>, can even shift between pathogenicity and endophytism within the same host depending on the environmental conditions. Here, we aim to disentangle the relationship between lifestyle and host range in <i>Colletotrichum</i>. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate that lifestyle is dependent on the host colonized in many <i>Colletotrichum</i> fungi. We discuss the ways in which pathogenic <i>Colletotrichum</i> species may act endophytically on alternative hosts, how comparative genomics has uncovered candidate molecules (namely effectors, CAZymes, and secondary metabolites) underlying fungal lifestyle, and the merits of using endophytic fungi alongside pathogenic fungi in research, which facilitates the use of reverse genetics to uncover molecular determinants of lifestyle. In particular, we reference the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>-<i>Colletotrichum tofieldiae</i> study system as a model for elucidating the dual roles of plant-fungus interactions, both endophytic and pathogenic, through integrative omics approaches and reverse genetics. This is because <i>C. tofieldiae</i> contains closely related pathogens and endophytes, making it an ideal model for identifying candidate determinants of lifestyle. This approach could identify key molecular targets for effective pathogen management in agriculture. Lastly, we propose a model in which pathogenic lifestyle occupies a different host range than the endophytic lifestyle. This will enhance our understanding of pathogenicity and endophytism in a globally significant fungal genus and lay the groundwork for future research examining molecular determinants of lifestyle in plant-associated fungi.
40005782	Microbial Community Structure and Diversity of Endophytic Bacteria and Fungi in the Healthy and Diseased Roots of <i>Angelica sinensis</i>, and Identification of Pathogens Causing Root Rot.	<i>Angelica sinensis</i> (Oliv.) Diels is an important traditional Chinese herbal medicine, and its main medicinal part is the root. In recent years, root rot has become one of the bottlenecks hindering the healthy and green development of <i>Angelica</i> cultivation due to the inappropriate application of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, plant growth regulators, and continuous cropping. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was adopted to reveal the differences in the community structure and diversity of endophytic bacteria and fungi in the roots of healthy and diseased <i>A. sinensis</i>. The results showed that the diversity index of endophytic bacterial communities was significantly higher in healthy root than in diseased <i>Angelica</i> root systems. There was a significant difference in endophytic fungal community diversity only at the m1 sampling site. There was a significant difference in the β-diversity of bacterial communities, but not of fungi. In terms of community composition, Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum of bacteria, and <i>Sphingobium</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> were the dominant genera; Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant phyla of fungi, and <i>Plectosphaerella</i>, <i>Paraphoma</i>, and <i>Fusarium</i> were the dominant genera. In addition, the relative abundance of the genera <i>Sphingobium</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i> was higher in healthy roots, while <i>Fusarium</i> was higher in diseased samples. Among the five pathogens isolated from diseased root, four strains were <i>Fusarium sp.</i>, and one was <i>Paraphoma chrysanthemicola</i>, which is reported for the first time. Our findings indicate that the endophyte community structure of <i>A. sinensis</i> infected with root rot changed significantly compared with healthy plants, and <i>Fusarium</i> is an important pathogenic factor, which provides a valuable microbiological basis for the targeted biocontrol of <i>Angelica</i> root rot.
40005746	Screening, Identification, and Fermentation Optimization of the Antagonistic Actinomycete Strain TCS21-117 Against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>.	Biological control is considered one of the most important methods for preventing and controlling the worldwide fungal disease gray mold, caused by <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Among the various agents used in biological control, actinomycetes represent a significant group of microorganisms that offer valuable resources for biocontrol strategies. In this study, a total of 132 actinomycetes, belonging to four genera (<i>Streptomyces</i>, <i>Kitasatospora</i>, <i>Amycolatopsis</i>, and <i>Nocardia</i>), were isolated from soil. Among the five media tested, ISP-2 and GS NO.1 media were found to be highly suitable for isolating actinomycetes. It is worth mentioning that the strain TCS21-117 displayed significant inhibitory effects against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and nine other pathogenic fungi. The strain TCS21-117 was identified as <i>Streptomyces roietensis</i> by its morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. The optimum culture conditions for the strain TCS21-117 were a potato dextrose broth medium at an initial pH of 8.0, a liquid volume of 125 mL in a 250 mL flask, 180 r·min<sup>-1</sup> at 28 °C, and an inoculum size of 1% for 7 days. Under these conditions, the inhibition rate against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> was 93.31%, a significant increase (31.98%) as compared to the control. Notably, the antifungal compounds produced by the strain TCS21-117 exhibited strong stability across a range of temperatures, pH levels, and durations of storage and UV irradiation. This study showed that the <i>Streptomyces roietensis</i> strain TCS21-117 had strong inhibitory activity against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> under optimized fermentation conditions, enriching the microbial resources for gray mold control.
40005738	Biochemical Features of the Cry3A Toxin of <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> subsp. <i>tenebrionis</i> and Its Toxicity to the Red Imported Fire Ant <i>Solenopsis invicta</i>.	Bioinsecticides based on the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) are widely used as safe alternatives to chemical insecticides. The insecticidal activity of Bt is occasioned by a protein toxin contained in parasporal crystals (Cry proteins) that are synthesized and laid down alongside the endospore during sporulation. The specificity of toxin action is associated with the subspecies of Bt and the individual Cry toxins they produce. Although a number of commercial Bt formulations are available to control moths, mosquitoes and beetles, there are none that control the red imported fire ant (RIFA) <i>Solenopsis invicta</i>. The present report is the first to describe the insecticidal activity of the Cry3A protein toxin, produced by <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> subsp. <i>tenebrionis</i> (Btt), against the RIFA as well as some of its key biochemical properties. Currently available commercial formulations of Btt are designed to control beetles such as the Colorado potato beetle, not ants. The Cry3A toxin (MW ~66 kDa) is embedded in a larger polypeptide (protoxin, MW ~73 kDa) and is released from the toxin enzymatically. Once activated, it can be administered to the RIFA as a soluble protein that most likely binds to an attendant receptor in the epithelial cells that line the wall of the larval ventriculus, killing the insect. Properly customized, the Cry3A toxin is a potential candidate for fire ant control.
40005650	Parasitism by Entomopathogenic Fungi and Insect Host Defense Strategies.	Entomopathogenic fungi, a group of insect pathogens, are characterized by high insecticidal efficacy and minimal environmental impact. They are commonly used as biopesticides for pest control due to their significant practical value. We here classify entomopathogenic fungi according to the process of fungal infection in hosts, changes in host behavior during infection, and mechanisms of spore transmission, and review the strategies employed by insects to resist infection, including physical barrier defenses, immune system defenses, and behavioral avoidance of fungal pathogens. This review also discusses the pathogenic mechanisms of fungi on insects and the closely linked co-evolution between fungal pathogens and insect defenses. In conclusion, a perspective on future research is provided, emphasizing the impact of insect population density and spore concentration in the environment on disease outbreaks.
40005482	Using an Aqueous Suspension of <i>Duddingtonia flagrans</i> Chlamydospores and a Hexane Extract of <i>Artemisia cina</i> as Sustainable Methods to Reduce the Fecal Egg Count and Larvae of <i>Haemonchus contortus</i> in the Feces of Periparturient Ewes.	This study evaluated the effectiveness of <i>Duddingtonia flagrans</i> chlamydospores and an <i>Artemisia cina</i> hexane extract in reducing <i>Haemonchus contortus</i> fecal egg counts and larvae in periparturient ewes. This study involved five groups of four ewes: a control group, an ivermectin group, an <i>A. cina</i> oral extract group, a <i>D. flagrans</i> group, and a combined treatment group. Treatments began two weeks before delivery, with ivermectin administered 15 days before delivery. Fecal samples were collected every fifteen days to estimate parasite egg counts per gram of feces (EPG) and assess larvae reductions. The results showed very low EPG values for ivermectin and <i>D. flagrans</i> treatments (175 and 150, respectively). The control and combined treatment groups had EPG values rise to 3000 and 4100 by day 15. The EPG values for the <i>A. cina</i> group reached 850 and 533 in later samplings. Throughout the study, the <i>D. flagrans</i> and <i>A. cina</i> groups maintained low EPG values, with the highest recorded values being 50 and 0, respectively. All treatments significantly reduced the larvae in the fecal cultures: <i>D. flagrans</i> (97.4% reduction), ivermectin (91.4%), <i>Artemisia cina</i> (89.9%), and the combined treatment (84.3%).
40005455	Cutaneous Anguillulosis During Immunotherapy for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.	Immunotherapy has been widely applied to treat metastatic renal cell cancer patients. Managing the side effects of immunotherapy can be a challenge. Here, we describe a rare presentation of cutaneous anguillulosis during immunotherapy. The patient experienced a rash eruption after receiving immunotherapy for metastatic renal cell cancer. The diagnosis of skin toxicity caused by immunotherapy was rejected after the failure of treatment by cortisone. The travelling history and a laboratory test confirmed the presence of anguillulosis infection. A diagnosis of cutaneous anguillulosis was established. Satisfactory treatment with ivermectin was achieved for cutaneous lesions. Immunotherapy was restored without any skin symptoms. We suggested the possible mechanism of cutaneous demonstration of immune inflammatory syndrome during the immunotherapy of a cancer patient with parasitic infection. It was concluded that a comprehensive search for previous infectious pathogens should be performed to ensure a correct diagnosis and timely treatment.
40005184	Variation in Linseed Oil Composition: Impact of Cultivar, Cultivation System, and Year of Cultivation.	Linseed oil quality depends on cultivar and agriculture practice/conditions. In this study, we analyzed the effect of the main variable, which was continuous cropping system vs. crop rotation system. The aim of this study was to compare the oil content and composition (fatty acid composition and sterol, tocochromanol, carotenoid, and phenolic contents) of two fiber-type linseed cultivars (Modran and Nike). All measurements were performed according to standard chromatographic/spectrophotometric procedures typical for oil analysis. The factors that affected the crop yield and oil quality of the tested cultivars included the cultivation system (crop rotation or continuous cropping), plant protection level (herbicide application or no herbicide application), and year of cultivation (2018 and 2019). The cultivars exhibited high oil content (35.4-42.7%) with substantial omega-3 fatty acid (α-linolenic acid) content (53.6-62.2% of total fatty acids). The primary bioactive components in all the oils were sterols (dominated by β-sitosterol), with their content reaching 5079 mg/kg, and tocochromanols, with their content reaching 679 mg/kg (dominated by γ-tocopherol), which was influenced by all of the studied factors. In contrast, carotenoids and phenolic compounds constituted a smaller fraction of the oils (up to 17 and 159 mg/kg, respectively), but their content was the most variable and was strongly dependent on the cultivation year and cultivation system (CV 21 and 37%, respectively). In summary, the results of the current study showed that continuous linseed cropping resulted in increased levels of carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and γ-tocopherol in oil. Our findings indicated that the oil content was mostly affected by the cultivar and cultivation year, while the α-linolenic acid content in the oil was also affected by plant protection practices. These findings may be helpful in predicting the composition of obtained linseed oil and applying proper cultivation technology, depending on the purpose of oil usage.
40005163	Simultaneous Determination of Six Acidic Herbicides and Metabolites in Plant Origin Matrices by QuEChERS-UPLC-MS/MS.	This study presents a method for the simultaneous determination of six acidic herbicides and their metabolites in various matrices, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and edible oils. The method employs acidified acetonitrile extraction combined with dispersive solid-phase extraction cleanup (dSPE) using MgSO<sub>4</sub>, Florisil, and Graphitized carbon black (GCB). The analysis was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) in both positive and negative modes using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The mass concentrations of six herbicide pesticides and their metabolites were predominantly within the range of 0.0005~0.050 mg/L and exhibited strong linear relationships with the corresponding peak area, with the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) exceeding 0.993. The limits of detection (LOD) for the method ranged from 0.0001 to 0.008 mg/kg. The recovery rates of adding recovery experiments to cabbage, chives, pear, wheat flour, and soybean oil were 69.8~120%, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 0.6~19.5%. The results indicate that this method is efficient and fast, and can be used for the detection of compounds in various actual matrices.
40005162	Ethnobotany, Phytochemistry, and Biological Activity of Extracts and Non-Volatile Compounds from <i>Lantana camara</i> L. and Semisynthetic Derivatives-An Updated Review.	<i>Lantana camara</i> L., commonly known as pigeon berry, is a herbaceous plant of growing scientific interest due to the high medicinal value. In fact, despite being categorized as an invasive species, it has been used for a long time to treat different diseases thanks to the many biological activities. Triterpenes, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, and iridoid glycosides are the bioactive compounds naturally occurring in <i>L. camara</i> that have demonstrated anticancer, antifilarial, nematocidal, antibacterial, insecticidal, antileishmanial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. The aim of this review is to update the information concerning the chemistry and biological activity of <i>L. camara</i> extracts and their constituents, including semisynthetic derivatives, revising the literature until June 2024. We believe that the data reported in this review clearly demonstrate the importance of the plant as a promising source of medicines and will therefore stimulate further investigations.
40005055	Balancing Health and Sustainability: Assessing the Benefits of Plant-Based Diets and the Risk of Pesticide Residues.	The increased consumption of fruit and vegetables is essential for moving towards a healthier and more sustainable diet. Vegetarian diets are gaining in popularity due to their environmental and health implications; however, there is a need for additional research investigating pesticide residues in these foods. It is increasingly recognized that the global food system must prioritize nutritional quality, health, and environmental impact over quantity. Food contaminants, including pesticides, mycotoxins, and heavy metals, pose a substantial threat to food safety due to their persistent nature and harmful effects. We conducted a literature search utilizing four distinct databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, NIH, ScienceDirect) and several combinations of keywords (pesticides, food, vegetarian diet, toxicity, sustainable, removal). Consequently, we selected recent and relevant studies for the proposed topic. We have incorporated articles that discuss pesticide residues in food items, particularly in plant-based products. This study rigorously analyzes the harmful environmental impacts of pesticides and ultimately provides sustainable solutions for their elimination or reduction, along with environmentally sound alternatives to pesticide use. This study concludes that the transition towards sustainable agriculture and food production is essential for reducing pesticide residues in food, thereby protecting human health, wildlife populations, and the environment. This paper argues for the urgent need to transform global food systems to prioritize health and sustainability.
40004543	Comprehensive Genomic Analysis of <i>Meyerozyma guilliermondii</i> CECT13190: An Outstanding Biocontrol Agent.	Biocontrol agents (BCAs) are gaining attention as sustainable alternatives to chemical pesticides. Understanding their molecular mechanisms is crucial for improving plant protection. This study investigates the genomic features of <i>Meyerozyma guilliermondii</i> CECT13190, a promising BCA, to identify key genes involved in its biocontrol abilities.
40004243	Impact of Nutrient Stress on Plant Disease Resistance.	Plants are constantly exposed to abiotic and biotic stresses that seriously affect crop yield and quality. A coordinated regulation of plant responses to combined abiotic/biotic stresses requires crosstalk between signaling pathways initiated by each stressor. Interconnected signaling pathways further finetune plant stress responses and allow the plant to respond to such stresses effectively. The plant nutritional status might influence disease resistance by strengthening or weakening plant immune responses, as well as through modulation of the pathogenicity program in the pathogen. Here, we discuss advances in our understanding of interactions between nutrient stress, deficiency or excess, and immune signaling pathways in the context of current agricultural practices. The introduction of chemical fertilizers and pesticides was a major component of the Green Revolution initiated in the 1960s that greatly boosted crop production. However, the massive application of agrochemicals also has adverse consequences on the environment and animal/human health. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the connections between stress caused by overfertilization (or low bioavailability of nutrients) and immune responses is a timely and novel field of research with important implications for disease control in crop species. Optimizing nutrient management practices tailored to specific environmental conditions will be crucial in maximizing crop production using environmentally friendly systems.
40004225	Transcriptome Analysis and Resistance Identification of <i>bar</i> and <i>BPH9</i> Co-Transformation Rice.	Insect pests and weeds are the two major biotic factors affecting crop yield in the modern agricultural system. In this study, a brown planthopper (BPH) resistance gene (<i>BPH9</i>) and glufosinate tolerance gene (<i>bar</i>) were stacked into a single T-DNA cassette and transformed into an indica rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) line H23. The present study employed a gene stacking process that combines more than one gene/trait into an individual transgenic plant to meet the increasing cropping demands under complex conditions. The transgenic rice H23 (H23R) co-expressing <i>bar</i> and <i>BPH9</i> genes demonstrated both glufosinate tolerance and BPH resistance. We utilized transcriptome data to reveal the mechanism of <i>BPH9</i>-mediated brown planthopper resistance and to analyze the impact of exogenous transgenic fragments on upstream and downstream genes at insertion sites. The evaluation of insect resistance and glufosinate tolerance confirmed H23R as an excellent double-resistant transgenic rice. These findings indicate that H23R can satisfy insect management and weed control in the modern rice agricultural system. However, a deregulation study will help with prospective commercial planting.
40004209	Machine Learning-Aided Optimization of In Vitro Tetraploid Induction in Cannabis.	Polyploidy, characterized by an increase in the number of whole sets of chromosomes in an organism, offers a promising avenue for cannabis improvement. Polyploid cannabis plants often exhibit altered morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics with a number of potential benefits compared to their diploid counterparts. The optimization of polyploidy induction, such as the level of antimitotic agents and exposure duration, is essential for successful polyploidization to maximize survival and tetraploid rates while minimizing the number of chimeric mixoploids. In this study, three classification-based machine learning algorithms-probabilistic neural network (PNN), support vector classification (SVC), and k-nearest neighbors (KNNs)-were used to model ploidy levels based on oryzalin concentration and exposure time. The results indicated that PNN outperformed both KNNs and SVC. Subsequently, PNN was combined with a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize oryzalin concentration and exposure time to maximize tetraploid induction rates. The PNN-GA results predicted that the optimal conditions were a concentration of 32.98 µM of oryzalin for 17.92 h. A validation study testing these conditions confirmed the accuracy of the PNN-GA model, resulting in 93.75% tetraploid induction, with the remaining 6.25% identified as mixoploids. Additionally, the evaluation of morphological traits showed that tetraploid plants were more vigorous and had larger leaf sizes compared to diploid or mixoploid plants in vitro.
40004208	Integrative Analysis of Transcriptomics and Proteomics for Screening Genes and Regulatory Networks Associated with Lambda-Cyhalothrin Resistance in the Plant Bug <i>Lygus pratensis</i> Linnaeus (Hemiptera: Miridae).	The prolonged use of pyrethroid insecticides for controlling the plant bug <i>Lygus pratensis</i> has led to upward resistance. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and potential regulatory pathways associated with lambda-cyhalothrin resistance in <i>L. pratensis</i>. In this study, we constructed a regulatory network by integrating transcriptome RNA-Seq and proteome iTRAQ sequencing analyses of one lambda-cyhalothrin-susceptible strain and two resistant strains, annotating key gene families associated with detoxification, identifying differentially expressed genes and proteins, screening for transcription factors involved in the regulation of detoxification metabolism, and examining the metabolic pathways involved in resistance. A total of 82,919 unigenes were generated following the assembly of transcriptome data. Of these, 24,859 unigenes received functional annotations, while 1064 differential proteins were functionally annotated, and 1499 transcription factors belonging to 64 distinct transcription factor families were identified. Notably, 66 transcription factors associated with the regulation of detoxification metabolism were classified within the zf-C2H2, Homeobox, THAP, MYB, bHLH, HTH, HMG, and bZIP families. Co-analysis revealed that the <i>CYP6A13</i> gene was significantly up-regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. The GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the co-up-regulated DEGs and DEPs were significantly enriched in pathways related to sphingolipid metabolism, Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, ABC transporters, RNA transport, and peroxisome function, as well as other signaling pathways involved in detoxification metabolism. Conversely, the co-down-regulated DEGs and DEPs were primarily enriched in pathways associated with Oxidative phosphorylation, Fatty acid biosynthesis, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, and other pathways pertinent to growth and development. The results revealed a series of physiological and biochemical adaptations exhibited by <i>L. pratensis</i> during the detoxification metabolism related to lambda-cyhalothrin resistance. This work provided a theoretical basis for further analysis of the molecular regulation mechanism underlying this resistance.
40004142	Effective Dose Reduction of Emamectin Benzoate Through Inhibition of <i>Bx-SDR3</i> in Pine Wood Nematode Management.	Pine wood nematodes (<i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>, PWNs) are a major threat to <i>Pinus koraiensis</i> in northeast China, and emamectin benzoate (EB) is commonly used for their control. Although high doses of EB can alleviate symptoms of pine wilt disease (PWD), they do not fully eradicate PWNs due to their detoxification mechanisms. This study investigates the content of EB in <i>P. koraiensis</i> and its efficacy in controlling PWNs after exogenous application of EB. We found that while EB significantly reduced PWN populations, it did not eliminate them. Transcriptomic analysis of PWNs treated with concentration at 20% (LC<sub>20</sub>) revealed that PWNs exhibit detoxification responses to low EB concentrations (LC<sub>20</sub>), driven by the <i>Bx-SDR3</i> gene. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of this gene decreased the detoxification ability of PWNs and enhanced the toxic effects of LC<sub>20</sub> EB by 20.9%. These results highlight the key role of <i>Bx-SDR3</i> in PWN detoxification and suggest that targeting this gene could improve the effectiveness of EB, offering a promising strategy for more efficient and eco-friendly pest management.
40004140	Correlations Between Amelioration of Rotenone-Induced Parkinson's Symptoms by <i>Amomum tsaoko</i> Flavonoids and Gut Microbiota in Mice.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, but the existing therapeutic drugs for PD have limitations; thus, there is an urgent need to discover new methods of prevention and treatment. <i>Amomum tsaoko</i> Crevost et Lemarie (AT) is a classic traditional Chinese medicine and food. Its main pharmacological effect is the regulation of the gastrointestinal tract. To date, no studies on the use of AT or its extracts to treat PD have been reported. In this study, a rotenone-induced PD mouse model was utilized to evaluate the protective effect of <i>Amomum tsaoko</i> flavonoids (ATFs) and to elucidate the role of the gut microbiota in this effect. The results demonstrated that ATFs not only ameliorated the motor and constipation symptoms but also reduced the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, ATFs reduced the expression of inflammation-related genes (<i>TNF-α</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, <i>IL-6</i>, <i>COX-2</i>, and <i>MCP-1</i>) and increased the expression of gut barrier-related genes (<i>Muc-2</i>, <i>ZO-1</i>, <i>Occludin</i>, <i>Claudin3</i>, and <i>Claudin4</i>) in the colon. Notably, ATFs were able to reverse rotenone-induced gut dysbiosis, including a significant decrease in the abundance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria (<i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Provotellaceae UCG-001</i>, the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>_<i>NK4A136_group</i>, <i>norank_f_Erysipelotrichacea</i>, and the <i>Eubacterium nodatum group</i>) and an increase in the abundance of probiotics (<i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Faecalibaculum</i>). Interestingly, these genera were found to be significantly associated with PD motor symptoms and constipation indicators. This suggests that ATFs have the potential to alleviate PD symptoms through the modulation of gut microbes. These findings provide a solid foundation for further investigations into the anti-PD mechanism of ATFs and their potential in the prevention and treatment of PD.
40004138	Motor and Non-Motor Effects of Acute MPTP in Adult Zebrafish: Insights into Parkinson's Disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) has been extensively used in different animal species to develop chemical models of PD. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acute exposure to MPTP (3 × 150 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on adult zebrafish by assessing the neurochemical, transcriptional, and motor changes associated with PD pathogenesis. MPTP treatment resulted in a significant decrease in brain catecholamines, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and normetanephrine. Additionally, a trend towards decreased levels of dopamine precursors (tyrosine and L-DOPA) and degradation products (3-MT and DOPAC) was also observed, although these changes were not statistically significant. Gene expression analysis showed the downregulation of <i>dbh</i>, while the expression of other genes involved in catecholamine metabolism (<i>th1</i>, <i>th2</i>, <i>mao</i>, <i>comtb</i>) and transport (<i>slc6a3</i> and <i>slc18a2</i>) remained unaltered, suggesting a lack of dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Behavioral assessments revealed that MPTP-exposed zebrafish exhibited reduced motor activity, consistent with the observed decrease in dopamine levels. In contrast, the kinematic parameters of sharp turning were unaffected. A significant impairment in the sensorimotor gating of the ASR was detected in the MPTP-treated fish, consistent with psychosis. Despite dopamine depletion and behavioral impairments, the absence of neurodegeneration and some hallmark PD motor symptoms suggests limitations in the validity of this model for fully recapitulating PD pathology. Further studies are needed to refine the use of MPTP in zebrafish PD models.
40003981	CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing in the Diamondback Moth: Current Progress, Challenges, and Prospects.	The development of site-specific genome-editing tools like CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat) and its associated protein, Cas9, is revolutionizing genetic engineering with its highly efficient mechanism, offering the potential for effective pest management. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing has been extensively utilized in the management of the diamondback moth, <i>Plutella xylostella</i> (L.), a highly destructive pest of vegetable crops, for different purposes, such as gene function analysis and genetic control. However, the progress related to this gene-editing tool in <i>P. xylostella</i> has not yet been summarized. This review highlights the progress and applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in uncovering the genes critical for development, reproduction, and insecticide resistance in <i>P. xylostella</i>. Moreover, the progress related to the CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive for population suppression and modifications has also been discussed. In addition to the significant progress made, challenges such as low germline editing efficiency and limited homology-directed repair remain obstacles to its widespread application. To address these limitations, we have discussed the different strategies that are anticipated to improve the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9, paving the way to it becoming a pivotal tool in sustainable pest management. Therefore, the present review will help researchers in the future enhance the efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and use it to manage the diamondback moth.
40003964	Metabolomics, Genetics, and Environmental Factors: Intersecting Paths in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.	Abdominal aortic aneurysm represents a significant public health concern, particularly in men aged 55 to 64, where it occurs in about 1%. We investigated the metabolomics and genetics of AAA by analyzing a cohort including 76 patients with AAA and randomly selected 228 controls. Utilizing the Metabolon DiscoveryHD4 platform for non-targeted metabolomics profiling, we identified several novel metabolites significantly associated with AAA. These metabolites were primarily related to environmental and lifestyle factors, notably smoking and pesticide exposure, which underscores the influence of external factors on the progression of AAA. Additionally, several genetic variants were associated with xenobiotics, highlighting a genetic predisposition that may exacerbate the effects of these environmental exposures. The integration of metabolomic and genetic data provides compelling evidence that lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors are intricately linked to the etiology of AAA. The results of our study not only deepen the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of AAA but also pave the way for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.
40003857	Effect of Processing Parameters on the Heating Uniformity of Postharvest Tobacco Leaves Subjected to Radio Frequency Disinfestations.	Uneven heating is the biggest obstacle to the application of radio frequency (RF) technology in insecticidal applications. Since many existing studies have focused on the RF heating uniformity of granular materials, few RF treatment solutions have been reported for leaf materials. To improve the RF heating uniformity of tobacco leaves, a combined RF-hot air treatment method was developed for disinfestation in this study. The experiments were conducted to determine the effects of three process parameters (electrode gap, sample thickness, and hot air temperature) on the RF heating rate and uniformity of tobacco leaves. The results showed that the heating rate of RF-hot air combined treatment increased with decreasing electrode gap but increased with increasing sample thickness and hot air temperature. The RF heating uniformity in tobacco leaves decreased with increasing heating rate but could be significantly improved with the conveyor movement. Considering the heating uniformity and heating rate, the material thickness of 60 mm and electrode gap of 110 mm were selected as optimal process parameters. The results of the study may provide a feasible method to improve the RF heating uniformity in tobacco leaves and potential applications for effective disinfestations.
40003854	Risk Assessment of RNAi-Based Potential Pesticide ds<i>NlAtg3</i> and Its Homologues for <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> and Non-Target Organisms.	The brown planthopper (<i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>) is an insect pest of rice, which mainly feeds on the phloem sap of the leaf sheath. RNA interference (RNAi) has application prospects in pest control, but it is necessary to select target genes and design suitable dsRNA fragments for RNAi so that it can achieve effective pest control and avoid risks to non-target organisms. NlAtg3 is a key protein in the autophagy pathway of <i>N. lugens</i>. Three kinds of dsRNA fragments of the <i>NlAtg3</i> gene (ds<i>NlAtg3-</i>474×1, ds<i>NlAtg3</i>-138×3 and ds<i>NlAtg3</i>-47×10) were designed to compare the RNAi efficiency and specificity against the target insect <i>N. lugens</i> and non-target organisms through microinjection. The results showed that the fragment ds<i>NlAtg3-</i>474×1 showed strong inhibitory effects on the survival of <i>N. lugens</i>, which resulted in the survival rate decreasing to zero on the fifth day, while the survival rate of a closely related species, <i>Sogatella furcifera</i>, dropped to 2.22%. In contrast, ds<i>NlAtg3</i>-47×10 specifically designed against <i>N. lugens</i> only showed slight or no inhibitory effects on <i>S. furcifera</i> and other non-target organisms such as <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, but still showed good lethal effects against <i>N. lugens</i>, with the survival rate dropping to 18.89% on the ninth day. In addition, after being fed <i>N. lugens</i> injected with ds<i>NlAtg3</i>-47×10 fragments, the survival rate of the natural enemies <i>Dolomedes sulfureus</i> and <i>Tytthus chinensis</i> did not show significant change, compared with those treated with the ds<i>GFP</i> control. Our results suggest that the <i>NlAtg3</i> gene can serve as a potential target for controlling <i>N. lugens</i>. Moreover, by designing suitable RNAi fragments, it is possible to avoid harm to non-target organisms while effectively inhibiting the target insect <i>N. lugens</i>.
40003841	Genome-Wide Identification and Expression Profiling of Odorant-Binding Protein Genes in the Bean Flower Thrips <i>Megalurothrips usitatus</i> (Bagnall) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae).	<i>Megalurothrips usitatus</i> is an economically important vegetable pest. Because of the growing demand for reducing pesticide use on vegetables, new environmentally friendly strategies for controlling <i>M. usitatus</i> are urgently needed. Insect odorant-binding proteins are prospective targets for screening environmentally friendly odorant attractants for pest control. However, very little is known about OBP genes in <i>M. usitatus</i>. Here, we identified 14 <i>OBPs</i> in the <i>M. usitatus</i> genome using HMMER and BLAST. The chromosomal location showed that these <i>OBPs</i> were widely distributed across eight chromosomes. The analysis of the gene and protein structure characteristics of OBPs in <i>M. usitatus</i> revealed substantial diversity within the OBP gene family. The spatiotemporal expression profiles showed that ten out of 14 <i>MusiOBPs</i> displayed male biased expression, which were highly expressed in antennae, suggesting that they may play a crucial role in the recognition of host plant volatiles and thrips aggregation pheromones. Notably, only <i>MusiOBP8</i> was significantly higher expressed in female adults, indicating a potential involvement in reproduction. Moreover, <i>MusiOBP7</i> and <i>MusiOBP13</i> were highly expressed in the pupae, indicating their possible role in immune responses. These results provide an important foundation for further exploration of the functions of the OBPs in <i>M. usitatus</i>.
40003835	Daily Prey Consumption and Functional Response of <i>Orius insidiosus</i>: Implications for Biological Control of <i>Scirtothrips dorsalis</i> in Strawberries.	Strawberry is an important specialty crop grown in Florida. Recently, chilli thrips, <i>Scirtothrips dorsalis</i> Hood (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), have become a significant threat to Florida strawberry production. Pesticide applications are not always recommended because of the development of insecticidal resistance. Biological control can be a viable control option for this pest. However, the management of <i>S. dorsalis</i> using predatory bug <i>Orius insidiosus</i> Say (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) has never been explored in strawberries. Therefore, this study's aim was to evaluate the predation efficacy of <i>O. insidiosus</i> through daily consumption rate and the functional response while preying on <i>S. dorsalis</i>. The results suggest that adult <i>O. insidiosus</i> has a significantly higher daily consumption rate than fifth-instar nymphs when feeding on both life stages of <i>S. dorsalis</i>. A Type II functional response was expressed by <i>O. insidiosus</i> when feeding on larval and adult <i>S. dorsalis,</i> indicating that the predation rate can increase with the prey density before it reaches a saturation point. The attack rates (a) and prey handling time (T<sub>h</sub>) were also computed on second-instar larvae and adult <i>S. dorsalis</i>, respectively. The results indicate that <i>O. insidiosus</i> can be used as an augmentation biocontrol agent for <i>S. dorsalis</i> management in strawberries.
40003834	Widespread Distribution of <i>chs-1</i> Mutations Associated with Resistance to Diflubenzuron Larvicide in <i>Culex pipiens</i> Across Italy, Reaching Virtual Fixation in the Venetian Lagoon.	Control interventions against mosquito larvae are the primary measure to reduce the adult abundance and risk of arbovirus outbreaks in Europe. One of the most commonly used larvicides in Italy is diflubenzuron (DFB), which targets chitin synthase 1 (<i>chs-1</i>), interrupting the normal development of larvae into adults. Recent studies identified high levels of DFB resistance in <i>Culex pipiens</i> populations from Emilia-Romagna (Italy) associated with I1043L/M/F mutations at position 1043 of the <i>chs-1</i> gene. The aim of the present study was to assess the circulation of 1043 resistance alleles in <i>Cx. pipiens</i> populations across Italy, outside Emilia-Romagna, with a focus on the Veneto region. Overall, 1032 specimens were genotyped. The 1043L allele was found in all examined Italian regions (Trentino-Alto Adige 19-36%; Veneto 0-91%; Piemonte 11%; Liguria 28%; Lazio 0-8%; Puglia 5%). The highest frequencies (up to >90%) were observed in the Venetian lagoon, where 1043M was also detected (6-11%). Overall, the relatively low frequencies of 1043 mutations despite extensive and longstanding use of DFB in Italy suggest a high fitness cost worthy of further investigations, while their extremely high frequencies in coastal touristic sites point to these sites as the most relevant for resistance monitoring and larvicide rotation.
40003830	Laboratory Evaluation of a Novel Insecticide, Isocycloseram, Against the Common Bed Bug (<i>Cimex lectularius</i> L.) (Hemiptera: Cimicidae).	Isocycloseram is a novel insecticide belonging to the class of isoxazoline (IRAC MoA Group 30) that exhibits excellent efficacy and selectivity against invertebrate pests. We evaluated the efficacy of two 0.1% isocycloseram formulations against a laboratory and four insecticide-resistant field strains of common bed bugs (<i>Cimex lectularius</i> L.) (Hemiptera: Cimicidae) by direct spray and forced exposure on three surfaces (fabric, vinyl tiles, and unpainted pinewood). Their efficacy was compared with that of five commercial insecticides including Demand CS (0.03% λ-cyhalothrin), Temprid FX (0.05% imidacloprid and 0.025% β-cyfluthrin), Crossfire (0.4% clothianidin, 0.01% metofluthrin, and 1.0% piperonyl butoxide), Bedlam Plus (0.4% d-phenothrin, 1.0% MGK 264, and 0.05% imidacloprid), and PT Phantom II (0.5% chlorfenapyr). Both isocycloseram 45 SC and 400 SC formulations were the most effective among the tested insecticides. The isocycloseram 45 SC formulation caused faster mortality than the 400 SC formulation. Four hours of exposure to 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1% isocycloseram 45 SC residue on porous and non-porous surfaces caused 100% bed bug mortality after 3-4 days. Exposure to 30-day-aged 0.1% isocycloseram 45 SC residue for 4 h still caused 100% mortality, compared to 0-73% mortality by the five commercial insecticides. Isocycloseram is a highly effective compound for controlling resistant <i>C. lectularius</i> populations.
40003822	Ultrastructure and Transcriptome Analysis of the Larval Integument in Solitary and Gregarious Phases of <i>Mythimna separata</i>.	<i>Mythimna separata</i> larvae exhibit both solitary and gregarious phases under low and high population density, respectively; furthermore, differences in morphology, behavior and physiology have been observed in the two phases. The integument plays an essential role in the fitness, general metabolism, communication, and survival of insects; however, differences in the integument ultrastructure and gene expression in the solitary and gregarious phases are largely unknown. In this study, the integument ultrastructure of larvae in the solitary and gregarious phases was compared, and transcriptome analysis was conducted to identify which genes were differentially expressed in the two phases. The results showed that the gregarious larvae had thicker integuments and more polygonal particles on the cuticle surface than solitary larvae. Using the Illumina HiSeq™ sequencing platform, 2774 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were generated. Among these, many transcripts were identified with roles in the synthesis of fatty acids; structural components of the integument and the insecticide detoxification were differentially expressed in the integument of the two larval phases. qRT-PCR was used to validate expression patterns of the selected transcripts. This study provides a valuable resource for understanding the molecular basis of behavioral and physiological differences in the two phases of <i>M. separata</i>.
40003819	Formulation of Entomopathogenic Nematodes for Above-Ground Use Against Tomato Leaf Miner, <i>Phthorimaea absoluta</i>.	The tomato leaf miner <i>Phthorimaea</i> (syn. <i>Tuta</i>) <i>absoluta</i> Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is invasive in many agricultural regions. Its larvae feed inside leaf mines or tomato fruits and are difficult to reach with plant protection products. In contrast, entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are highly virulent and can search for larvae. The challenge is to formulate EPNs to remain protected on a sprayed leaf surface until they enter the mines. We tested 11 formulations, including 2 oils, 4 gels or thickeners, 2 surfactants, 2 UV protectants, water, and combinations with and without the EPN <i>Steinernema carpocapsae</i> (Weiser) RW14-G-R3a-2 (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae), under non-closed low-humidity conditions. Six tomato leaf experiments with 1000 EPNs sprayed per leaf showed that EPNs in 0.25 to 0.5% canola oil or in 5% alkyl polyglycoside surfactant were the most effective (26 to 37%). Other formulations and an insecticide had less or no effect. Seven other bioassays showed that most formulations did not adversely affect EPN survival or pathogenicity. We assume that formulations of EPNs can be further improved, such as with other flowable gels or combinations, and encourage investment in the development of practical and economic protective sprayable formulations of EPNs against leaf miners to reduce reliance on chemical insecticides.
40003814	Properties of "Stable" Mosquito Cytochrome P450 Enzymes.	The use of insecticides is widespread in the control of debilitating mosquito-borne diseases. P450 enzymes (CYPs) play essential roles in mosquito physiological function but also in the enzymatic detoxification of xenobiotics. Broadly speaking, CYPs can be classified as "stable", meaning those that have no or very few paralogs, and "labile", constituting gene families with many paralogous members. The evolutionary dichotomy between "stable" and "labile" P450 genes is fuzzy and there is not a clear phylogenetic demarcation between P450s involved in detoxification and P450s involved in essential metabolic processes. In this study, bioinformatic methods were used to explore differences in the sequences of "stable" and "labile" P450s that may facilitate their functional classification. Genomic and sequence data of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> (<i>Agam</i>), <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (<i>Aaeg</i>), and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> (<i>Cqui</i>) CYPs were obtained from public databases. The results of this study show that "stable" CYPs are encoded by longer genes, have longer introns and more exons, and contain a higher proportion of hydrophobic amino acids than "labile" CYPs. Compared to "labile" CYPs, a significantly higher proportion of "stable" CYPs are associated with biosynthetic and developmental processes.
40003813	Efficacy of Chlorobenzene as a New Fumigant for Control of Confused Flour Beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and Rice Weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).	Chlorobenzene is an industrial chemical with relatively high vapor pressure and has been used in the past to produce pesticide DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane). In this study, chlorobenzene was demonstrated to be an effective fumigant against two stored product insects: the confused flour beetle (<i>Tribolium confusum</i>) and rice weevil (<i>Sitophilus oryzae</i>). In small-scale fumigations in 1.9 L glass jars, the complete control of adults of both the confused flour beetle and rice weevil was achieved in 24 h at a dose of 150 μL/L at 21 °C. LC<sub>95</sub> values of chlorobenzene vapor concentration for adults of the confused flour beetle and rice weevil were estimated to be 1121 and 1114 ppm, respectively. In large-scale fumigations in a 60 L chamber, all life stages of the confused flour beetle and rice weevil in 20 kg of corn were fumigated for 24 h with 30 mL (500 μL/L) chlorobenzene at 21 °C. The complete control of adults and immature stages of the confused flour beetle was achieved. For the rice weevil, adults had 100% mortality, and immature life stages had 97.8% mortality. These results demonstrated that chlorobenzene is effective as a fumigant against stored product insects, and it is technically feasible to conduct large-scale fumigations for postharvest pest control on stored products.
40003811	Diversity of Gut Bacteria of Field-Collected <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Larvae and Females, Resistant to Temephos and Deltamethrin.	The <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito serves as a vector for several diseases, including dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. This species is well adapted to urban environments and poses a significant threat to public health. Some studies suggest that the gut bacteria of insect vectors may play a crucial role in developing resistance to insecticides. This study assessed the resistance of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> from Florencia, Caquetá, to temephos and deltamethrin and analyzed the diversity of gut bacteria in resistant larvae and adult females. Larvae exhibited resistance to temephos at a lethal concentration 50 (LC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.034 µg/mL, while females showed resistance to deltamethrin at a discriminant concentration of 10 µg/mL. The bacterial load in the guts of deltamethrin-treated females (3.42 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) was significantly higher compared to temephos-treated larvae (9.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL) and untreated females (8 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL). A total of sixty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from the guts of both larval and resistant females <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, with 31 strains identified through 16S rRNA gene analysis and 11 confirmed by <i>gyrB</i> gene sequencing. In untreated females, <i>Bacillus</i> comprised 12.55% of the gut bacteria and was identified as an exclusive genus. In resistant larvae, <i>Serratia</i> was the most abundant and exclusive genus, accounting for 35.29%, while in resistant females, <i>Cedecea</i> was the predominant genus, representing 66.67%. These findings suggest that gut bacteria may influence the resistance of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> to temephos and deltamethrin. Furthermore, this research provides valuable information that can be considered for the design of local vector control strategies. The results highlight new research focused on the study of insecticide tolerance and degradation within the gut microbiota of insect vectors of arboviruses.
40003795	Establishing an IPM System for Tarnished Plant Bug (Hemiptera: Miridae) in North Carolina.	Prior to 2010, <i>Lygus lineolaris</i> Palisot de Beauvois was a minor pest in North Carolina cotton, <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L., but became one of the top pests by 2017. This insect was already a persistent pest in other US cotton-producing regions. Initial work focused on addressing near-term management needs and documenting locally relevant ecology and population dynamics of the pest in North Carolina. Landscape factors were found that correlated with tarnished plant bug incidence. Adult numbers tended to be higher in fragmented fields (more field edges) and nymph numbers were higher near field edges. The minimum required sample for estimating tarnished plant bug populations was studied. Thresholds developed in the Midsouth were proven to be useful in a study between both southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Furthermore, an insecticide application sequence was recommended based on efficacy trials, number of expected insecticides, and preserving beneficial insects early in the season. These were evaluated in a study investigating IPM systems approaches. Finally, new management tactics for tarnished plant bug, such as ThryvOn cotton, are being evaluated. As new management strategies and tactics are developed, they will need to be evaluated for their fit in this IPM system.
40003792	Towards a Rational Basis for the Selection of Probiotics to Improve Silkworm Health and Performance.	Pathogenic infections of silkworms constitute the greatest threat to sericulture. An attractive approach to the improvement in silkworm health and performance comprises the use of probiotics, i.e., microorganisms that confer beneficial properties such as an increased growth rate and resistance against pathogens. While this method has already resulted in promising results, generally, there is a lack of a rational basis for guidance on the selection of probiotics. This review attempts to organize useful information that needs to be considered for the successful application of probiotics: the constitution of the microbiota in silkworms and its origins; the interaction of the major silkworm pathogens with the microbiota; and the microorganisms that have been used so far as silkworm probiotics. Our analysis points to two major issues that seem of vital importance: (1) the absence of a "core microbiota" in silkworms which necessitates continuous supply of beneficial microorganisms according to environmental conditions and (2) the apparent negative impact that some other microorganisms can have on resistance against baculovirus infections. Recent findings have reported the beneficial effects of lactic acid bacteria (<i>Lactobacillus</i> sp.) when applied as probiotics in improving silkworm health and performance.
40003786	Neem and Gliricidia Plant Leaf Extracts Improve Yield and Quality of Leaf Mustard by Managing Insect Pests' Abundance Without Harming Beneficial Insects and Some Sensory Attributes.	Production and consumption of vegetable crops has seen a sharp increase in the recent past owing to an increasing recognition of their nutraceutical benefits. In tandem, there has been unwarranted application of agrochemicals such as insecticides to enhance productivity and vegetable quality, at the cost of human health, and fundamental environmental and ecosystem functions and services. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of neem and gliricidia botanical extracts in managing harmful insect pest populations in leaf mustard. Our results report that neem and gliricidia plant extracts enhance the yield and quality of leaf mustard by reducing the prevalence and feeding activity of harmful insect pests in a manner similar to synthetic insecticides. Some of the key insect pests reduced were <i>Lipaphis erysimi</i>, <i>Pieris oleracea</i>, <i>Phyllotreta Cruciferae</i>, <i>Melanoplus sanguinipes</i>, and <i>Murgantia histrionica</i>. However, compared to synthetic insecticides, neem and gliricidia plant extracts were able to preserve beneficial insects such as the <i>Coccinellidae</i> spp., <i>Trichogramma minutum</i>, <i>Araneae</i> spp., <i>Lepidoptera</i> spp., and <i>Blattodea</i> spp. Furthermore, plant extracts did not significantly alter sensory attributes, especially taste and odor, whereas the visual appearance of leaf mustard was greater in plants sprayed with neem and synthetic insecticides. Physiologically, plant extracts were also able to significantly lower leaf membrane damage as shown through the electrolyte leakage assay. Therefore, these plant extracts represent promising pesticidal plant materials and botanically active substances that can be leveraged to develop environmentally friendly commercial pest management products.
40003782	Identification of Candidate Olfactory Genes in the Antennal Transcriptome of <i>Loxostege sticticalis</i> Trapped by Three Different Sex Pheromone Blends.	Insects sense intraspecific or interspecific information about the chemical substances in the habitat through the sensitive olfactory system to carry out foraging, mating, oviposition, and other activities. The antennae serve as the primary olfactory organs in insects. The olfactory process involves the participation of many proteins, such as odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and odorant receptors (ORs), but ORs play a central role in olfactory specificity and sensitivity. The beet webworm, <i>Loxostege sticticalis,</i> is an omnivorous agricultural pest that endangers crops and poses a significant risk to the agricultural and animal husbandry production in northern China. In this study, Illumina sequencing was conducted on the antennal transcriptome of male <i>L. sticticalis</i> trapped by three different sex pheromone blends. A total of 10,320 DEGs were identified, from which 46 candidate olfactory genes were selected for further analysis. These candidate olfactory genes comprise 13 odorant receptors, 6 ionotropic receptors (IRs), 3 gustatory receptors (GRs), 12 odorant-binding proteins, and 13 chemosensory proteins (CSPs). In summary, we analyzed the antennal transcriptome of male <i>L. sticticalis</i> trapped by three different sex pheromone blends and identified several candidate olfactory genes. This discovery offers a foundation for further molecular-level investigations into the olfactory system of <i>L. sticticalis</i>.
40003768	Botanical Antifeedants: An Alternative Approach to Pest Control.	Plant protection against phytophagous pests still largely relies on the application of synthetic insecticides, which can lead to environmental and health risks that are further exacerbated by the development of resistant pest populations. These are the driving forces behind the current trend of research and the development of new ecological insecticides. The mode of action does not have to rely exclusively on acute or chronic toxicity. Another promising approach is the use of plant antifeedants, which can significantly reduce the food intake of phytophagous insects. However, the information on antifeedant substances has not yet been sufficiently evaluated. The aim of this review was to find the most promising plants that provide potent extracts, essential oils (EOs), or isolated compounds with antifeedant properties. The selection was based on a comparison of effective concentrations or doses. Effective extracts were obtained from 85 plant species belonging to 35 families and the EOs came from 38 aromatic plant species from 11 families. Based on the results, <i>Angelica archangelica</i>, <i>Caesalpinia bonduc</i>, <i>Grindelia camporum</i>, <i>Inula auriculata</i>, <i>Lavandula luisieri</i>, <i>Mentha pulegium, Piper hispidinervum</i>, and <i>Vitis vinifera</i> were selected as promising plants with antifeedant potential. These plants are potent antifeedants, and at the same time provide sufficient biomass for industrial use in the development and production of botanical antifeedants.
40003767	Chemosterilant Potential of Insect Growth Regulators for Management of <i>Bactrocera cucurbitae</i> (Diptera: Tephritidae).	The melon fruit fly, <i>Bactrocera cucurbitae</i>, is an important insect pest responsible for significant yield losses in vegetables. Conventional control methods, like pesticide applications, have certain limitations, including environmental contamination. This study evaluated the chemosterilant potential of five new insect growth regulators (IGRs)-Pyriproxyfen; Novaluron; Lufenuron; Buprofezin; and Flubendiamide-at concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 ppm in a 5 mL diet against <i>B. cucurbitae</i>. Laboratory trials identified Lufenuron as the most effective IGR, which reduced fecundity by 68.4% and adult emergence by 70.97% at a 300 ppm concentration. Other IGRs, Pyriproxyfen; Novaluron; Buprofezin; and Flubendiamide, also significantly reduced fecundity and adult emergence at higher concentrations. Based on laboratory performance, Lufenuron was selected for field trials using six bait traps per 0.4 hectares. The field trials demonstrated a higher number of <i>B. cucurbitae</i> adult captures in Lufenuron-based bait traps compared to the control and reductions in crop damage, with fruit fly damage decreasing by 7.01% in August and 4.25% in September. This study highlights the potential of chemosterilant baited traps as a promising approach for integrated fruit fly management programs in cucurbitaceous vegetables.
40003759	Volatile Cues from Fresh Cattle Dung Can Drive Horn Fly Egg-Laying and Fecal Attraction to Horn Flies, <i>Haematobia irritans</i> (Diptera: Muscidae).	The horn fly is an economically important hematophagous ectoparasite of cattle. Its management relies heavily on broad-spectrum pesticides, which are harmful to the environment and have led to the development of resistance. Therefore, alternative control methods are needed. Semiochemicals involved in communication between horn flies and their host are a promising alternative. Considering that the egg-laying of this fly occurs almost exclusively in fresh cattle dung, and most parts of its life cycle occur totally in dung, dung volatiles might play an important role in horn fly behavior. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of volatile blends and compounds emitted from fresh/aged cattle dung on the olfactory response and oviposition of horn flies. Dung blends were captured and analyzed by SPME-GC/MS. <i>p</i>-Cresol was the most abundant compound in dung blends, followed by <i>α</i>- and <i>β</i>-pinene, limonene, and <i>β</i>-caryophyllene, among other common dung volatiles. Fresh-dung volatiles attracted males and females in a Y-tube olfactometer, and they elicited the egg-laying of flies in two-choice tests. <i>p</i>-Cresol and α-pinene were attractive to females and they elicited higher oviposition, demonstrating that dung volatile semiochemicals, in part, lend to dung attractiveness and stimulate the horn fly oviposition.
40003756	Impact of Direct Contact and Ingestion of Selected Insecticides on the Predator <i>Harmonia axyridis</i> of Citrus Psyllids.	The Asian citrus psyllid, <i>Diaphorina citri</i>, serves as the primary vector for Huanglongbing (HLB) by transmitting <i>Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus. Lambda-cyhalothrin and thiamethoxam are commonly employed for the control of <i>D. citri</i>. The multicolored Asian lady beetle, or harlequin ladybird, <i>Harmonia axyridis</i>, is an important predator of <i>D. citri</i> in both greenhouse and field settings. The effectiveness of integrated pest management (IPM) relies on the judicious use of selective insecticides that minimize harm to natural enemies. However, the effects of these insecticides on <i>H. axyridis</i>' predation of <i>D. citri</i> remain thoroughly unexplored. In this study, we assessed the toxicity of lambda-cyhalothrin and thiamethoxam to <i>H. axyridis</i> and examined their impact on the functional response of this predator to <i>D. citri</i> using direct contact exposure methods. We also evaluated the indirect effects on predator voracity through ingestion exposure. Our results demonstrated that exposure to both insecticides at LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations significantly prolonged the developmental durations of <i>H. axyridis</i> larval stages. The type-II functional response model effectively described the prey consumption patterns of <i>H. axyridis</i>, revealing a significant reduction in predation capacity across all life stages, particularly among second instar larvae, which experienced reductions of 85.30% and 88.58% following lambda-cyhalothrin and thiamethoxam treatments, respectively. Furthermore, <i>H. axyridis</i>' predation significantly declined when feeding on <i>D. citri</i> contaminated at LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations. These findings indicate that lambda-cyhalothrin and thiamethoxam adversely affect the predation of <i>H. axyridis</i>, both via direct contact and ingestion. Evaluating the potential impacts of these insecticides on <i>H. axyridis</i> is critical for the development of effective IPM strategies targeting <i>D. citri</i>.
40003747	Eradication of Yellow Crazy Ants, <i>Anoplolepis gracileps</i> Smith, from Lismore and Statistical Proof of Freedom Using Scenario Tree Analysis.	Yellow crazy ants (YCAs) are an invasive ant with a pantropical distribution, largely due to the international movements of ships and produce. This invasive ant has the capacity to impact a broad range of environmental, domestic and agricultural situations and has the ability to develop into supercolonies and dominate landscapes if uncontrolled. YCAs have been detected in several locations in Australia. During 2018 in New South Wales, YCAs were detected in two locations in the Lismore region. Several awareness techniques were used to gain community support and engagement in the response program. The eradication program relied on the insecticide fipronil (several formulations), and the program subsequently used surveillance data to demonstrate that eradication had been achieved. We used the scenario tree analysis with stochastic models to estimate the likelihood of eradication. We combined the results of the passive and active surveillance systems to predict a 70.4% (62.7-80.7) probability of freedom of detecting one nest, 84.4% (73.9-94.4) probability of freedom for two nests and 98% (93.1-99.9) probability of freedom for five nests. The results from the scenario tree analysis were used to inform program managers regarding the termination of the eradication and surveillance activities.
40003744	Evaluation of Bacterial Communities of <i>Listronotus maculicollis</i> Kirby Reared on Primary and Secondary Host Plants.	The annual bluegrass weevil (<i>Listronotus maculicollis</i> Kirby) is a devastating insect pest of annual bluegrass (<i>Poa annua</i> L.) and, to a lesser extent, creeping bentgrass (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i> L.) on golf courses. <i>Listronotus maculicollis</i>-reared <i>A. stolonifera</i>, a comparatively tolerant host, incurs fitness costs, including longer developmental periods and reduced larval survivorship. This study sought to characterize microbiota diversity in <i>L. maculicollis</i> adults and larvae reared on <i>P. annua</i> and <i>A. stolonifera</i> cultivars (Penncross & A4) to explore whether intrinsic factors, such as microbial community composition, vary across host plants and developmental stages, potentially influencing host suitability. Alpha diversity analyses showed adults feeding on A4 exhibited higher bacterial species richness than their offspring reared on the same cultivar. Beta diversity analysis revealed significant dissimilarities between <i>L. maculicollis</i> adults and offspring regardless of host. <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. was consistently abundant in larvae across all turfgrasses, indicating a potential association with larval development. Elevated levels of <i>Wolbachia</i> sp., known for insect reproductive manipulation, were observed in adults, but appear to be unrelated to host plant effects. The most prevalent bacterium detected was <i>Candidatus</i> Nardonella, a conserved endosymbiont essential for cuticular hardening in weevils. Given the role of cuticular integrity in insecticide resistance, further investigations into insect-microbe-plant interactions could guide the development of targeted pest management strategies, reducing resistance and improving control measures for <i>L. maculicollis</i>.
40003738	Cost-Effective Monitoring of Spruce Budworm Larvae.	The spruce budworm, <i>Choristoneura fumiferana</i> Clem. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is the most severe defoliator of balsam fir (<i>Abies balsamea</i>) in eastern Canada and northeast U.S.A. A large budworm outbreak is currently underway in the province of Québec, with 10.5 million hectares defoliated in 2023, up 14.1% from the year before. Populations of budworms are controlled using management guidelines of Forest Protection Strategy (FPS); the approach aims at killing defoliating larvae with aerial application of microbial insecticide, with the objective to limit defoliation and prevent tree mortality. The decision to treat/not treat a given forest block is based, in part, on local density of overwintering second instars (<i>L2</i>) collected at ca. 600 sampling points each year across the entire province at a cost of CAD 350 for three branches per site; the threshold for FPS (T<sub>FPS</sub>) corresponds to 20 <i>L2</i>/branch. Aerial defoliation maps also guide management decisions because FPS generally target areas within or in the vicinity of defoliated forest stands. Budworm abundance rapidly declines with distance to aerial defoliation (in km), to the extent that larval density rarely attains T<sub>FPS</sub> outside the core range of FPS (>15 km from defoliation). A cost-effective monitoring approach is proposed whereby forest blocks outside the core range of FPS are sampled every second year (as opposed to every year), representing a potential economy of CAD 40,000 annually.
40003736	Long-Term Exposure to Lambda-Cyhalothrin Reveals Novel Genes Potentially Involved in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Insecticide Resistance.	Insecticide resistance in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> populations hinders vector control programs. Many studies have focused on the classical mechanisms, <i>kdr</i> mutations, and metabolic enzymes to understand the development of insecticide resistance. In this study, we subjected a strain of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> to selective pressure for 13 consecutive generations to understand the development and extent of insecticide resistance. We delved into the transcriptomics of this pressured strain to gain insights into the molecular changes underlying insecticide resistance in <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. Our data suggest mosquito resistance is influenced by additional mechanisms that are difficult to explain using only classical mechanisms. The response by mosquitoes varies depending on the exposure time. Initially, when mosquitoes are in contact with insecticides, they modulate the expression of metabolic enzymes and gain some point mutations in the sodium channel genes. After long-term exposure, the mosquitoes respond to insecticides by expressing different proteins involved in the cuticle, energetic metabolism, and synthesis of proteases. We propose a model that includes these novel mechanisms found after prolonged insecticide exposure, which work in conjunction with established mechanisms (<i>kdr</i> and metabolic resistance) but have a different timeline in terms of expression and appearance.
40003567	Exposure to Acute Concentration of Malathion Induced Behavioral, Hematological, and Biochemical Toxicities in the Brain of <i>Labeo rohita</i>.	A surge has been observed in the use of pesticides to boost agricultural yield in order to feed the continuously increasing human population. Different types and classes of broad-spectrum insecticides are in use, and the number is constantly increasing with the introduction of new ones. Keeping in view the broad-spectrum effects of organophosphate pesticides including Malathion (MLN), their use is continuously increasing without appraising their toxic impacts on non-target organisms. The continuous rise in the use of MLN has led to its presence, persistence, and transport to water bodies globally, subsequently affecting commercially valuable aquatic organisms. The current study was conducted to assess MLN-induced hematological and biochemical toxicities in the brain of a commercially valuable indigenous major carp, rohu, <i>Labeo rohita</i>. The fish was exposed to an acute concentration of commercial-grade MLN. The LC<sub>50</sub> of MLN (5 µg/L) led to behavioral inconsistencies and subtle impacts on the hematology (an increase in white blood cells and a reduction in red blood cells, hemoglobin, packed cell volume level, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) and biochemistry (an increase in reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-S-transferase) but a reduction in total protein content and activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPases) in the brain tissues. MLN also inhibited the activity of Acetylcholinesterase, while it led to an increase in Acetylcholine. Significant changes were observed in the serum biochemical profile; for example, glucose, cholesterol, potassium, urea, and total bilirubin increased, whereas total protein, sodium, chloride, albumin, and inorganic phosphate decreased after exposure. The current study clearly classified MLN as highly toxic to rohu. Therefore, the extra-judicious use of MLN should be strictly supervised. Studies concerning the real-world concentration of pesticides should be carried out on regular basis to mitigate the echoing issue of pesticide-based pollution.
40003530	Environmental Challenges in Southern Brazil: Impacts of Pollution and Extreme Weather Events on Biodiversity and Human Health.	The Amazon rainforest plays a fundamental role in regulating the global climate and therefore receives special attention when Brazilian environmental issues gain prominence on the global stage. However, other Brazilian biomes, such as the Pampa and the Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil, have been facing significant environmental challenges, either independently or under the influence of ecological changes observed in the Amazon region. The state of Rio Grande do Sul is located in the extreme south of Brazil and in 2024 was hit by major rainfalls that caused devastating floods. The Pampa is a non-forest biome found in Brazil only in Rio Grande do Sul. This biome is seriously threatened by loss of vegetation cover and many classes of pollutants, including pesticides and plastics. Mining ventures are also important sources of soil, water and air pollution by potentially toxic elements in Rio Grande do Sul, threatening both the Pampa and the Atlantic Forest. Furthermore, southern Brazil is often affected by pollution caused by smoke coming from fires observed in distant biomes such as the Pantanal and the Amazon. Considering the significant environmental challenges observed in southern Brazil, this article revisits the historical participation of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazilian environmentalism and highlights the main environmental challenges currently observed in the state, followed by an in-depth analysis of the effects of pollution and extreme weather events on biodiversity and human health in the region. This review encompassed specifically the following categories of pollutants: potentially toxic elements (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, mercury, titanium), air pollutants, plastics, and pesticides. Pathogen-related pollution in the context of extreme weather events is also addressed. This article emphasizes the critical importance of often-overlooked biomes in Brazilian conservation efforts, such as the Pampa biome, while also underscoring the interconnectedness of climate change, pollution, their shared influence on human well-being and ecological balance, using Rio Grande do Sul as a case study.
40003523	Consumers' Health and Environmental Attitudes and Local Food Purchases.	There has been increasing interest in the health and environmental benefits of the growth of local food, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, local food and labels have many implications and attributes, such as organic, non-GMO, and reduced-chemical production. Therefore, consumers' purchase decisions and willingness to pay for local labels with sustainable attributes are heterogeneous. This study uses a consumer survey in Missouri to examine how differences and differentiations in health and environmental attitudes affect consumers' willingness to pay for local food. A discrete choice experiment and a structural equation model (SEM) were employed to measure how personal attitudes affect consumer's willingness to pay for local labels (typical label and state-grown). Results show that supportive attitudes toward local farms and farmers positively affect consumer preferences for locally labeled produce, but the premiums will be lower if they are more concerned about GMOs and pesticide residue in food. No evidence was found for the effects of general environmental attitudes on willingness to pay for local food.
40003485	Exploring Pesticide Knowledge, Practices, and Health Perceptions Among Farmers in Akkar, Lebanon.	The unregulated and widespread use of agricultural pesticides in Lebanon has led to critical health and environmental challenges. Small-scale farmers in Akkar, a key agricultural region, are particularly vulnerable due to limited knowledge, unsafe practices, and insufficient access to safety resources.
40003437	Determinants of Safe Pesticide Handling and Application Among Rural Farmers.	The study investigated the determinants of safe pesticide handling and application among farmers in rural communities of Oyo State, ssouthwestern Nigeria. A cross-sectional design utilizing 2-stage cluster sampling techniques was used to select Ido and Ibarapa central Local Government Areas and to interview 383 farmers via a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression at <i>p</i> = 0.05. Results showed that 41.8% of the farmers had been working with pesticides on farms for at least 5 years, 33.0% attended training on pesticide application, 73.5% had good safety and health knowledge, and 72.3% had safe pesticide handling and application practices. About half (50.2%) stated that they wear coveralls, gloves, and masks to protect their body, face, and hands when applying pesticides, 9.8% use empty pesticide containers for other purposes in the house/farm, while 11.5% blow the nozzle with their mouth to unclog it if it becomes blocked. The three major health symptoms reported by the participants were skin irritation (65.0%), itchy eyes (51.3%), and excessive sweating (32.5%). Having attended training on pesticide application and use enhanced (OR = 2.821; C.I = 1.513-5.261) practicing safe pesticide handling and application. Farmers with good knowledge (OR = 5.494; C.I = 3.385-8.919) were more likely to practice safe pesticide handling and application than those with poor knowledge about pesticide use. It is essential to develop and deliver mandatory comprehensive training programs for farmers on impacts of pesticides on health and environment, along with sustainable safe handling, application, and disposal of pesticides using proper waste management techniques and recognizing early signs and seeking medical assistance. The urgent need to strengthen policy to regulate pesticide use and limit farmers' access to banned products is also key.
40002127	Is Common Dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i> agg.) Foraged for Food in Vineyards Pesticide Residues Free?	Consumption of common dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i> agg.) can pose a risk when foraged in agroecosystems like vineyards where pesticides are frequently used. The aims of our study are to evaluate whether dandelion foraged in vineyards with different management practices (integrated pest management, organic, and biodynamic) in spring is suitable for consumption and to assess whether the contents of selected pesticide residues (PR) in integrated vineyards in dandelion vary throughout the seasons. Young dandelion leaves were sampled in spring, summer, and autumn in integrated vineyards, while in spring also in organic and biodynamic vineyards. The selected PR was analyzed using GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS, using extraction with acetonitrile. The method was validated on a dandelion matrix according to international guideline SANTE 11312/2021. Despite the use of many pesticides in integrated vineyards, only tebuconazole was detected in spring in one sample (0.005 mg/kg), while no PR was detected in dandelion from organic and biodynamic vineyards. However, at summer sampling seven different PR were detected, of which the kresoxim-methyl maximum residue limit was exceeded in five samples (0.012-0.029 mg/kg), while in autumn no PR was detected. Based on this study, it seems that dandelion leaves foraged in vineyards in spring could be unproblematic for consumption.
40002065	Advanced Photocatalytic Degradation of Organic Pollutants Using Green Tea-Based ZnO Nanomaterials Under Simulated Solar Irradiation in Agri-Food Wastewater.	The increasing presence of various organics poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and living organisms. Conventional water treatment methods are often insufficient, necessitating the development of powerful and sustainable alternatives. This study addresses this challenge by exploring the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles using green tea leaves extract-an eco-friendly approach-for the sunlight-activated removal of organics in agri-food wastewater. The research examined different conditions for the removal of clomazone (CLO), tembotrione (TEM), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and zearalenone (ZEA). Nitrate-derived ZnO synthesized in a water medium (N-gZnO<sub>w</sub>) exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity, removing 98.2, 95.8, 96.2, and 96.6% of CLO, TEM, CIP, and ZEA. Characterization techniques (XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, zeta potential measurements, UV-visible spectroscopy) confirmed the synthesis of N-gZnO<sub>w</sub>, with an average particle size of 14.9 nm, an isoelectric point of 9.9, and a band gap energy of 2.92 eV. Photocatalytic experiments identified 0.5 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> as an optimal catalyst loading, while a higher initial pollutant concentration reduced degradation efficiency. LC-ESI-MS/MS measurements confirmed the efficient pollutant degradation and the formation of degradation intermediates. Hence, this study demonstrates that green tea extract-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles offer a promising, sustainable solution for removing herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and mycotoxins from wastewater, paving the way for eco-friendly water purification technologies.
40002016	Reduced Doses of Diatomaceous Earth and Basil Essential Oil on Stored Grain Against the Wheat-Damaging <i>Sitophilus oryzae</i>: Influence on Bread Quality and Sensory Profile.	Stored grain pests like <i>Sitophilus oryzae</i> pose significant challenges to food security and quality, necessitating eco-friendly pest management strategies. This study investigates the combined efficacy of reduced doses of diatomaceous earth (DE) and basil (<i>Ocimum basilicum</i> L.) essential oil (EO) as an alternative to conventional pesticides. Laboratory trials evaluated the effectiveness of the treatments-DE, EO, and a mixture of both (at halved doses)-against <i>S. oryzae</i> in wheat, alongside their impact on bread quality and sensory attributes. Results showed that DE and the DE + EO at halved doses combination achieved over 82% pest mortality, comparable to standard DE doses but with reduced mechanical and environmental drawbacks. EO alone demonstrated limited insecticidal activity. Bread made from treated wheat retained high sensory acceptability, with DE enhancing elasticity and crumb aroma. EO-enriched bread exhibited a complex aromatic profile due to methyl chavicol, though with reduced crumb elasticity and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Shelf-life assessments indicated that DE and DE + EO at halved doses extended mold-free storage by one day compared to untreated bread. These findings highlight the potential of combining DE and EO at reduced doses to manage stored grain pests sustainably, aligning with integrated pest management (IPM) and organic farming principles, while preserving the technological and sensory qualities of derived food products.
40001915	Binary Mixture of Neonicotinoid-Pyrethroid Insecticide: Impact on Survival, Cognitive Learning, and Memory in <i>Apis mellifera jemenitica</i>.	The impact of agrochemicals on pollinators, especially honey bees, has drawn significant attention due to its critical implications for worldwide food stability and ecosystems. Given the potential threat of insecticides to honey bees, bees may encounter multiple insecticides simultaneously during foraging. This study investigated the toxic effect of an insecticide mixture (IM) containing acetamiprid (neonicotinoid) and deltamethrin (pyrethroid) on the survival and cognitive appetitive performance of <i>Apis mellifera jemenitica,</i> a vital native pollinator in arid regions of Saudi Arabia. The lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) was determined by assessing bees' mortality rates following exposure to IM through topical and oral routes. Significant bee mortality occurred at 4-48 h post treatment with IM through both exposure routes, showing a trend of increased mortality with higher IM concentrations compared to the control bees. Throughout all tested times, topical exposure proved relatively more effective, resulting in significantly greater bee mortality compared to oral exposure to IM. Food intake declined progressively with rising IM concentrations during oral exposure. The LC<sub>50</sub> values of IM at 24 h after treatment were 12.24 ppm for topical and 10.45 ppm for oral exposure. The corresponding LC<sub>10</sub>, LC<sub>20</sub>, and LC<sub>30</sub> values were 3.75 ppm, 5.63 ppm, and 7.54 ppm for topical exposure and 2.45 ppm, 4.04 ppm, and 5.78 ppm for oral exposure, respectively. The combination index (CI) revealed a synergistic effect (0.43) for topical exposure and antagonistic effects (1.43) for oral exposure, highlighting differential toxicity dynamics. IM exposure significantly impaired cognitive acquisition and memory reinforcement in honey bees, as demonstrated through behavioral assays, indicating potential neurotoxic effects. Learning and memory formation significantly declined at 2, 12, and 24 h after exposure to sublethal concentrations of IM through both topical and oral routes. Thus, evaluating the interactive impact of multiple pesticides on bees' health and cognitive function is essential, particularly in regions where diverse agrochemicals are routinely utilized.
40001893	Utilizing Olive Fly Ecology Towards Sustainable Pest Management.	The olive fly (<i>Bactrocera oleae</i>, OLF) is a major pest of global significance that occurs in places where olive cultivation thrives. This paper highlights the economic and environmental damage caused by OLF infestations, including reduced olive oil yield and quality, disrupted supply chains, and ecosystem imbalances due to heavy insecticide use. Understanding olive fly ecology is crucial for developing effective control strategies. The review explores the fly's life cycle, its relationship with olive trees, and how environmental factors like temperature and humidity influence population dynamics. Additionally, studying the role of natural enemies and agricultural practices can pave the way for sustainable control methods that minimize environmental harm. Climate change, intensive cultivation, and the development of resistance to insecticides necessitate a shift towards sustainable practices. This includes exploring alternative control methods like biological control with natural enemies and attract-and-kill strategies. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of OLF ecology, including its response to temperature and its ability to find refuge in diverse landscapes, is critical for predicting outbreaks and implementing effective protection strategies. By employing a holistic approach that integrates ecological knowledge with sustainable control methods, we can ensure the continued viability of olive cultivation, protect the environment, and produce high-quality olive oil.
40001513	Quinazolinones as Potential Anticancer Agents: Synthesis and Action Mechanisms.	Quinazolinones, essential quinazoline derivatives, exhibit diverse biological activities with applications in pharmaceuticals and insecticides. Some derivatives have already been developed as commercial drugs. Given the rising cancer incidence, there is a critical need for new anticancer agents, and quinazolinones show promising potential in this domain. The present review focuses on novel advances in the synthesis of these important scaffolds and other medicinal aspects involving drug design, the structure-activity relationship, and action mechanisms of quinazoline and quinazolinone derivatives, to help in the development of new quinazoline and quinazolinone derivatives.
40001300	An entomopathogenic strain of <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> (hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) against <i>Eotetranychus kankitus</i> (acarina: Tetranychidae) and its compatibility with <i>Neoseiulus barkeri</i> (acarina: Phytoseiidae).	<i>Eotetranychus kankitus</i> is an important pest on several agricultural crops, and its resistance to pesticides has promoted the exploration of biological control strategies. <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> and <i>Neoseiulus barkeri</i> have been identified as potential agents for suppressing spider mites. This study aimed to investigate the pathogenicity of <i>B. bassiana</i> on <i>E. kankitus</i> and its compatibility with <i>N. barkeri</i>. Results showed that among the five tested strains of <i>B. bassiana</i>, Bb025 exhibited the highest level of pathogenicity on <i>E. kankitus</i>. Higher application rates (1 × 10<sup>8</sup> conidia/mL) of Bb025 led to a higher mortality rate of <i>E. kankitus</i> (90.402%), but also resulted in a 15.036% mortality of <i>N. barkeri</i>. Furthermore, preference response tests indicated that both <i>E. kankitus</i> and <i>N. barkeri</i> actively avoided plants sprayed with Bb025 compared to the control group that was sprayed with Tween-80. In a no-choice test, we observed that <i>N. barkeri</i> actively attacked Bb025-treated <i>E. kankitus</i> with no adverse effect on its predatory capacities. Furthermore, <i>N. barkeri</i> laid more eggs when fed on Bb025-treated <i>E. kankitus</i> compared to Tween-80-treated <i>E. kankitus</i>, but the subsequent generation of surviving individuals fed on Bb025-treated <i>E. kankitus</i> was reduced. These findings demonstrate that the Bb025 strain of <i>B. bassiana</i> is highly virulent against <i>E. kankitus</i> while causing less harm to <i>N. barkeri</i>. Consequently, a promising strategy for controlling <i>E. kankitus</i> could involve the sequential utilisation of Bb025 and <i>N. barkeri</i> at appropriate intervals.
40001298	Insect Resistance to Insecticides: Causes, Mechanisms, and Exploring Potential Solutions.	Insecticides play a crucial role as the primary means of controlling agricultural pests, preventing significant damage to crops. However, the misuse of these insecticides has led to the development of resistance in insect pests against major classes of these chemicals. The emergence of resistance poses a serious threat, especially when alternative options for crop protection are limited for farmers. Addressing this challenge and developing new, effective, and sustainable pest management approaches is not merely essential but also critically important. In the absence of alternative solutions, understanding the root causes behind the development of resistance in insects becomes a critical necessity. Without this understanding, the formulation of effective approaches to combat resistance remains elusive. With insecticides playing a vital role in global food security and public health, understanding and mitigating resistance are paramount. Given the growing concern over insect resistance to insecticides, this review addresses a crucial research gap by thoroughly examining the causes, mechanisms, and potential solutions. The review examines factors driving resistance, such as evolutionary pressure and excessive pesticide use, and provides a detailed analysis of mechanisms, including detoxifying enzyme overproduction and target site mutations. Providing an analysis of potential solutions, it discusses integrated pest management, strategic insecticide rotation, and the use of new pest control technologies and biological agents. Emphasizing the urgency of a multifaceted approach, the review provides a concise roadmap for sustainable pest management, guiding future research and applications.
40001183	Subnational tailoring of malaria interventions to prioritize the malaria response in Guinea.	In the context of high malaria burden yet limited resources, Guinea's national malaria programme adopted an innovative subnational tailoring (SNT) approach, including engagement of stakeholders, data review, and data analytics, to update their malaria operational plan for 2024-2026 and identify the most appropriate interventions for each district considering the resources available.
40001182	Herbicide-related health risks: key mechanisms and a guide to mitigation strategies.	Herbicides are a group of substances used to control undesired vegetation in both agricultural and non-agricultural settings. They are recorded as the most consumed class among other pesticides, reaching nearly two million tons worldwide. Despite their effectiveness in weed control, the extensive utilization of herbicides has raised concerns regarding adverse effects on human health. However, comprehensive reviews addressing herbicide-related human health risks remain limited. This work aims to compile scientific evidence and possible underlying mechanisms to emphasize the hazards that need to be acknowledged, as well as to explore novel strategies for minimizing the impact on human health.
40000782	Phytochemical analysis of Asclepias syriaca L. leaf extract and its potential phytotoxic effect on some invasive weeds.	Leaf extract of Asclepyas syriaca was utilized to investigate the phytotoxic effects on the germination and seedling growth of Amaranthus retroflexus L., Chenopodium album L., and Iva xanthifolia Nutt. and to evaluate the relative chlorophyll content and oxidative stress of these weeds growing in pots. The total content of phenols in the extract and its antioxidant activity were determined before bioassays. The TPC was 43.3 ± 1.5 mg GAE g<sup>-1</sup> dry extract, while IC50 value of DPPH radical scavenging activity was 0.651 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> and FRAP value was 38.7 ± 1.5 μmol Fe<sup>2+ </sup>g<sup>-1</sup> d.e., UHPLC-MS analysis was carried out to identify and quantify the major compounds in it. A total of 15 phenolic compounds in the extract were quantified, including 4 flavonoids, 7 hydroxybenzoic acids, and 4 hydroxycinnamic acids. Delphinidin was the most abundant (32.5 mg g<sup>-1</sup> d.e.), followed by 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (1.810 mg g<sup>-1</sup> d.e.), rutin (1.533 mg g<sup>-1</sup> d.e.), p-coumaric acid (1.131 mg g<sup>-1</sup> d.e.), quercetin (1.071 mg g<sup>-1</sup> d.e.), gallic acid (0.946 mg g<sup>-1</sup> d.e.) and protocatechuic acid (0.598 mg g<sup>-1</sup> d.e.). The seed bioassay confirmed the inhibitory effect of leaf extract on the seed germination and early seedling growth of the tested weeds at all concentrations. In all tested plants the inhibition of seed germination ranged from 68 to 100%, while the inhibitory effect on early seedling growth (radical and shoot length) was ≥ 72% and up to 97-100% for root and 74 to 100% for shoot growth. The results obtained from the pot bioassays revealed significant oxidative stress and a decrease in the relative chlorophyll content. These findings evinced that A. syriaca leaf extract had a significant phytotoxic effect on tested weeds. However, further studies under field conditions are needed to confirm the presented results and to check its herbicidal potential.
40000754	Discrimination of inherent characteristics of susceptible and resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae by explainable artificial intelligence analysis of flight trajectories.	Understanding mosquito behaviours is vital for the development of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), which have been successfully deployed in sub-Saharan Africa to reduce disease transmission, particularly malaria. However, rising insecticide resistance (IR) among mosquito populations, owing to genetic and behavioural changes, poses a significant challenge. We present a machine learning pipeline that successfully distinguishes between innate IR and insecticide-susceptible (IS) mosquito flight behaviours independent of insecticidal exposure by analysing trajectory data. Data-driven methods are introduced to accommodate common tracking system shortcomings that occur due to mosquito positions being occluded by the bednet or other objects. Trajectories, obtained from room-scale tracking of two IR and two IS strains around a human-baited, untreated bednet, were analysed using features such as velocity, acceleration, and geometric descriptors. Using these features, an XGBoost model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.743 and a ROC AUC of 0.813 in classifying IR from IS mosquitoes. SHAP analysis helped decipher that IR mosquitoes tend to fly slower with more directed flight paths and lower variability than IS-traits that are likely a fitness advantage by enhancing their ability to respond more quickly to bloodmeal cues. This approach provides valuable insights based on flight behaviour that can reveal the action of interventions and insecticides on mosquito physiology.
40000704	Antinutritional and insecticidal potential of Chenopodium quinoa saponin rich extract against Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and its action mechanism.	Tribolium castaneum can inflict significant harm to stored grains. The use of novel, harmless, and effective biopesticides is needful to avoid the hazardous effects of chemical insecticides. On the other hand, saponins are antinutritional metabolites with large biological properties, and quinoa husk is one of the richest biomasses in these compounds. The biocidal and antinutritional effects of a saponin-rich extract (SRE) from Chenopodium quinoa husk were examined against T. castaneum adults by evaluating mortality, nutritional indices, and mortality rate. The effect on T. castaneum's enzymatic activity was also investigated. As a result, at concentrations above 25 mg/g of SRE, insects can no longer consume flour with a significant feeding deterrent (≥ 84.20%). The study showed that SRE has an acute and long-term effect on insect survival, which confirms that the mortality of T. castaneum is attributable to the toxic action of the saponin extract and not just the starvation action. In addition, SRE demonstrated its capacity to disrupt the wax layer of T. castaneum adults, penetrate insects, and react as oxidative stressors, which explain the affectation of the immune defense system of T. castaneum through the downregulation of phenoloxidase activity and glutathione S-transferase, the upregulation of the antioxidant system presented in this study with catalase activity, and causing organelle damage in the midgut tissues confirmed by the inhibition of amylase activity. According to the findings of this study, saponin extract has a very interesting application as an insecticide against storage insects.
40000653	Efficacy of pre-harvest weed control treatments on onion bulb storability.	Storage experiments were carried out, in 2019 and 2020, to evaluate the effect of pre-harvest weed control treatments on quality attributes and storability of onion bulbs during a six-month storage at room temperature (25 ± 5 °C and 50-60% relative humidity) in corrugated paper boxes. Weed control treatments consisted of the aqueous extracts of orange peel processing waste (OPPW) 20%, mango leaves waste (MLW) 30%, and olive oil processing waste (OOPW) 30%, alone or mixed with half a dose of oxyfluorfen herbicide (938 ml ha<sup>-1</sup>), soil mulching with orange peel processing waste, mango leaves, olive oil processing waste, and rice straw (OPPWM, OOPWM, MLW, and RSM, respectively) at 10 tons ha<sup>-1</sup>, hoeing, oxyfluorfen herbicide (at 938 and 1875 ml ha<sup>-1</sup>), and an unweeded control treatment. OPPW mulch and hoeing treatments were the most effective treatments in improving storability, decreasing weight loss and decay percentages of onion bulbs as well as maintaining bulb quality attributes, i.e., bulb firmness, dry matter, total soluble solids and total soluble sugars content during a six-months storage. It was concluded that using OPPW and MLW, as soil mulches or as aqueous extracts, for weed control within onion field, helps maintain onion bulb quality, and storability.
40000595	Sodium persulfate activated by solar radiation to generate sulfate anion radicals for degradation of the insecticide thiamethoxam in water.	The degradation of the neonicotinoid insecticide Thiamethoxam (TMX) by the oxidizing agent sodium persulfate (SP) activated by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, peracetic acid (PAA), pH, solar radiation, heating and sonication, also using combinations between the activators was evaluated. The optimal dosage of SP in the process was 10 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> and at this concentration the oxidants hydrogen peroxide and PAA did not contribute to the increase in TMX degradation even when exposed to solar radiation. Under conditions of greater acidity and exposure to solar radiation, the degradation efficiency of TMX increased and continued for days, even with sample storage in the absence of light. The process promoted a drastic reduction in the pH of the medium, meaning that it always occurred at an acidic pH, regardless of the initial pH. The degradation kinetics of TMX can be described by a Pseudo-second order model with higher reaction rate in acidic medium. Analysis employing a sequestering agent (isopropyl alcohol) indicated that the degradation efficiency of the process can be attributed to the generation of HO<sup>•</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-•</sup> radicals. Ecotoxicological analyses show greater toxicity of the sample after TMX degradation.
40000592	Synthesis of titania/activated carbon composites for the synergistic adsorption and photocatalysis of lindane in aqueous solutions.	Lindane (LIND) is an organochlorine pesticide, belonging to the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which are bioaccumulative with detrimental effects on human health and environment. In the present work, activated carbon (AC) produced from coffee waste after activation with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and pyrolysis at 800 °C (CWAC-NaOH-800) is tested as adsorbent of LIND, and as substrate for the synthesis of hybrid adsorbent/photocatalytic materials of titanium oxide with activated carbon (TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC) via the sol-gel method, aiming at the synergistic adsorption and photocatalysis of LIND. Three different TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC materials were synthesized at mass ratio of TiO<sub>2</sub> to AC equal to 2.0 (material TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC-0.2), 4.0 (material TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC-0.1), and 8.0 (material TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC-0.05). As the TiO<sub>2</sub> to AC mass ratio increases, the specific surface area and total pore volume of the composite materials decrease, the meso-/macro-porosity are reduced and a pore-and-throat microporous network is created within the agglomerates of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. The adsorption of LIND onto the CWAC-NaOH-800 is pH-independent and follows the Langmuir model with a maximum adsorption capacity equal to 9.74 mg/g. The adsorption mechanism is likely to be the hydrophobic interactions as generally ACs tend to repel water molecules and preferentially adsorb non-polar or hydrophobic compounds such as LIND. The mass transfer multi-compartment model was used to describe the LIND sorption dynamics in CWAC-NaOH-800 and TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC-0.1, by accounting for the film/pore/surface diffusion and instantaneous linear sorption, and it was found that the contribution fraction of surface diffusion and microporosity to the total LIND sorption was enhanced with the presence of TiO<sub>2</sub>, due to the decrease of meso-/macro-porosity. For the study of the adsorptive-photocatalytic capacity of composite materials, two experimental setups were tested and compared: an ultraviolet-A (UVA) oven with LEDs (power = 22 W, λ = 375 nm) radiating from the periphery to the center of the reactor, and a UVA lamp (power = 6 W, λ = 375 nm) radiating radially from the center to the reactor walls. The material TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC-0.1 showed LIND sorption capacity comparable to that of CWAC-NaOH-800 and photocatalytic performance better than that of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, due to the presence of AC and the "co-adsorption" effect. During the synergistic adsorption-photocatalysis process, the TOC removal efficiency reached 90% after 3 h of photocatalysis, which is indicative of the in situ regeneration of the material. From the inverse modeling of the adsorption-photocatalysis experiments, it was found that the kinetic constant of TiO<sub>2</sub>/AC-0.1 photocatalyst was highest in the experimental setup of the UVA lamp, showing a good balance between adsorptive and photocatalytic capacity.
40000369	Evaluation of Chiral Pesticide Chlorbufam at the Enantiomeric Level: Absolute Configuration, Separation, Herbicidal Activity, and Degradation in Soil.	Chlorbufam is a photosynthesis inhibitor chiral herbicide with a pair of enantiomers, which is rarely a concern. In this work, the optically pure enantiomers of chlorbufam were first synthesized and characterized, and the enantioselective herbicidal activity and mechanism were studied. Chlorbufam enantiomers showed significant differences in bioactivity against <i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i> and <i>Abutilon theophrasti</i>, and <i>R</i>-(+)-chlorbufam was identified as the most active against the targeted organisms with higher bioactivity of 3.95 and 1.71 times than <i>S</i>-(-)-chlorbufam. Chlorbufam enantiomers exerted herbicidal activity by inhibiting photosynthesis according to the results of the determination of photosynthetic pigment contents and molecular docking. Additionally, a novel HPLC-MS/MS method was successfully developed and validated for the detection of chlorbufam enantiomers and further applied for the enantioselective degradation study in soil. As a result, chlorbufam was satisfactory enantioseparated with a resolution of 2.37 on a Chiralpak IH column using the mobile phase of acetonitrile and water (60:40, v/v). Good linearity for chlorbufam enantiomers was obtained with correlation coefficients ≥0.9990, and the recovery ranged from 74.1 to 119% with relative standard deviations ≤10.9% at three spiked levels. The degradation behaviors of chlorbufam enantiomers were significantly different, and <i>S</i>-(-)-chlorbufam was preferentially degraded. The findings encouraged the application of enantiopure <i>R</i>-(+)-chlorbufam herbicide to reduce dosage rates, decrease environmental risks, and protect human health.
40000133	[Studies on the role of iron death in paraquat-induced mesenchymalization of alveolar epithelial cells].	<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the role of iron death in paraquat (PQ) -induced alveolar epithelial mesangialization (EMT) . <b>Methods:</b> In August 2023, the appropriate PQ staining concentration as well as the intervention concentration of lipoinhibitor-1 (Lip-1) were screened by CCK8 method. The RLE-6TN cells were divided into three groups, which were control group, PQ group and iron death inhibition group, 200 μmol/L PQ solution was given to the PQ group, and PQ 200 μmol/L and 0.1 μmol/L Lip-1 solution was given to the iron death inhibition group, the control group was added the same amount of cell medium. morphological changes and migratory viability of the cells in each group were observed at 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after the poisoning, and the contents of ferrous ions (Fe(2+)), reactive oxygen radicals (ROS), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected in each group; meanwhile, qRT-PCR and western-blot were used to determine the molecular expression of E-cadherin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and Collagen I in the cells in each group. The difference between group was compared by ANOVA, and the further pairwise comparison was conducted by Bonferroni method. <b>Results:</b> Cell viability was detected using CCK8, and the results showed that the cell survival rate of RLE-6TN cells treated with 200 μmol/L PQ+0.1 μmol/L Lip-1 solution was 56.6%. The migration activity of RLE-6TN cells in the iron death inhibition group was weaker than that in the PQ group after 24 and 48 hours of exposure, and the degree of EMT changes in the cells was reduced compared to the PQ group. After 12, 24, and 48 hours of exposure, the Fe(2+) concentration, ROS fluorescence intensity, and MDA content in the iron death inhibition group decreased compared to the corresponding time points in the PQ group (<i>P</i><0.05/3), while compared with PQ group, the GSH concentration and SOD concentration increased compared to the corresponding time points in the PQ group (<i>P</i><0.05/3). The results showed that compared with the control group, the expression levels of E-cadherin mRNA and protein in PQ group and iron death inhibition group were both decreased (<i>P</i><0.05/3), while compared with PQ group, the expression levels of E-cadherin mRNA and protein in iron death inhibition group were increased (<i>P</i><0.05/3) ; Compared with the control group, the expression levels of α-SMA, Collagen I mRNA and protein in PQ group and iron death inhibition group cells increased (<i>P</i><0.05/3), while compared with PQ group, the expression levels of α-SMA, Collagen I mRNA and protein in iron death inhibition group cells decreased (<i>P</i><0.05/3) . <b>Conclusion:</b> Ferroptosis is involved in the EMT process of alveolar epithelial cells induced by PQ. Inhibiting ferroptosis can reduce cellular oxidative damage and alleviate the degree of cellular EMT.
39999999	Discovery of Novel Amide Derivatives Containing an Oxazole/Isoxazole Moiety as Potential SDH Inhibitors: Design, Synthesis, and Nematicidal Activity.	To develop new nematicides, amide derivatives with oxazole/isoxazole were synthesized via scaffold-hopping as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitors. The nematicidal activities of these target compounds were tested against <i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>, <i>Aphelenchoides besseyi</i>, and <i>Ditylenchus destructor</i>. Some of the compounds showed excellent nematicidal activities.

Compound <b>B21</b> exerted a pronounced inhibitory effect on feeding, reproduction, and embryonic development capabilities of <i>B. xylophilus</i>, while concurrently triggering deleterious oxidative stress responses within the nematodes. These reactions led to intestinal damage and eventually death of the nematodes. Compound <b>B21</b> exhibited strong hydrophobic interactions with the residues Arg-76, Val-103, Pro-193, and Ile-242 of SDH. Additionally, <b>B21</b> significantly inhibited the SDH of <i>B. xylophilus</i>, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 6.5 μmol/L.
39999947	The role of microbiomes in shaping insecticide resistance: current insights and emerging paradigms.	Insecticide resistance is a global challenge in agriculture and public health, with the microbiome increasingly recognized as a key contributor. This review synthesizes current research on the microbiome's roles in insecticide resistance, emphasizing mechanisms like microbe-mediated insecticide detoxification, bioactivation, and modulation of host gene expression and physiology. We also explore how different environmental factors impact microbe-host interactions and the roles of epigenetics and post-transcriptional regulation in linking microbial effects to resistance. Integrating evidence from various insect species, this review also proposes strategies for resistance management, including genetically engineered microbes to detoxify insecticides and microbial diagnostic tools for monitoring resistance markers.
39999921	Cuticle thickening mediates insecticide penetration resistance in Spodoptera litura.	Long-term and extensive use of chemical pesticides has led to the development of resistance in many important agricultural pests. The mechanisms of resistance formation in pests are complex and variable, and unraveling the resistance mechanisms is the key to control resistant pests. Insect cuticle, as the first line of defense for insecticides, plays a non-negligible role in insecticide penetration resistance. Although penetration resistance is widespread in insects, the multiple molecular mechanisms that impede insecticide penetration are unclear, especially in Spodoptera litura.
39999704	Imidacloprid and amitraz differentially alter antioxidant enzymes in honeybee (Apis mellifera) hemocytes when exposed to microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns.	Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are increasingly exposed to pesticides and microbial stressors, yet their combined effects on immune defenses remain unclear. Exposure to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the acaricide amitraz, alone and in combination, alters antioxidant enzyme activity in hemocytes when challenged with bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan or the fungal-derived molecule zymosan A. The combination of pesticides with zymosan A synergistically suppresses superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase activity, while catalase activity remains unchanged. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide counteracts pesticide-induced oxidative stress, suggesting immune-pathway-specific modulation. The heightened vulnerability of honeybees to fungal-associated immune challenges in pesticide-contaminated environments compromises their ability to detoxify harmful substances and respond to infections. Such approaches that include comparison of different microbial interactions, pesticide cocktails, and immunity are needed. Understanding these interactions is essential for improving pesticide regulations and pollinator conservation efforts in the face of increasing environmental stressors.
39999548	Fluorescent molecularly imprinted hydrogel sensing strip based on nitrogen-doped carbon dots and inverse opal photonic crystals applying for effective detection for imidacloprid in fruits and vegetables.	This study integrated nitrogen-doped carbon dots (nitrogen-doped CDs) with remarkable fluorescence into a high-porosity inverse opal photonic crystal (IOPC) structure. A portable fluorescent hydrogel strip was developed by incorporating molecular imprinted biomimetic recognition, enabling the rapid identification and accurate detection of the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI). The ordered and hierarchical architecture of the IOPCs was advantageous to the uniform dispersion of nitrogen-doped CDs while providing efficient mass transfer channels for IMI. Additionally, the sensing strips achieved adsorption equilibrium within 20 min and demonstrated excellent selectivity, stability, and reusability. They showed a linear response to IMI across the range of 0.1-50 μg/mL (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9905) with a detection limit of 0.065 μg/mL (S/N = 3). The spiked recoveries ranged from 88.2 % to 102.8 %, aligning well with HPLC results. This indicates that the developed fluorescent molecularly imprinted hydrogel sensing strip is an effective analytical tool for detecting IMI residues in food products.
39999486	Persistent organic pollutants and plasma microRNAs: A community-based profiling analysis.	Whether exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may incur microRNAs (miRNAs) dysregulation remains largely unclear.
39999139	Quantifying variation of non-point source pollution and its impact factors: A study of Nansi Lake Basin.	Agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution directly affects the quality of soil and water, ecological balance and human health, and is a key challenge to achieve sustainable environmental development and efficient resource management. Taking the Nansi Lake Basin (NLB) as the study area, this study explores the main sources of agricultural NPS pollution and its influencing factors, aiming to provide scientific basis for the management of water resources in the basin. Current studies usually use the runoff pollution partitioning method to estimate agricultural NPS pollution loads in runoff, but the accuracy of the analyses is limited by the incompleteness of water quality monitoring data, especially the lack of complete runoff records in some years. To compensate for this deficiency, this study simulated the river runoff based on the Long-Term Hydrological Impact Assessment (L-THIA) model, and applied the simulation results to the quantitative calculation of agricultural NPS pollution loads after verifying the model reliability through accuracy calibration. Based on L-THIA model, the spatial and temporal distribution data of agricultural NPS pollution in the basin from 2010 to 2020 were obtained, the distribution characteristics of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) were quantitatively assessed, and the impacts of natural and socio-economic factors on them were analyzed. A regression model was developed to simulate future agricultural NPS pollution through multiple regression analysis. The results showed that the total agricultural NPS pollution in the NLB showed an increasing trend during the study period. In particular, among the socio-economic factors, COD and NH3-N were significantly correlated with fertilizer application, pesticide use, rural employment and total population. Among the natural factors, topographic index, watershed area and gully density were positively correlated with pollutants, while slope and soil organic matter were negatively correlated. The results of this study raise awareness of the contribution of influencing factors and allow researchers and planners to focus on the most important NPS pollution sources and influencing factors. The study provides an important reference for the prevention and control of agricultural NPS pollution in the NLB, which is of great practical importance.
39999124	Clinical safety and pharmacokinetics of a novel oral niclosamide formulation compared with marketed niclosamide chewing tablets in healthy volunteers: A three-part randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.	Niclosamide is an established anthelmintic substance and a promising candidate for treating cancer, viral infections, and other diseases. However, its solubility in aqueous media is low, and the systemic bioavailability of the commercially available chewing tablet is poor, limiting the use of niclosamide for systemic treatment. A liquid oral formulation using polyethylene glycol 400 was developed and investigated in healthy volunteers to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in comparison to the marketed tablet. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04644705).
39999022	A hidden artefact: how surfactants can distort the results of springtail reproduction tests.	Soils are exposed to multiple substance groups, including surfactants, which directly enter soils when they are used as additives in fire-fighting liquids or pesticide mixtures due to their surface tension-lowering properties. The impact of chemicals on soil health is often tested with the springtail reproduction test. We tested the effects of the trisiloxane Break-Thru® S 301 on the reproduction of Folsomia candida in three soils according to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline 232. Juveniles were extracted either by heat or flotation. In the latter method, recommended by OECD 232, test soil is flooded with water and stirred so that springtails float and swim on the water surface. Additionally, we tested the impact of Break-Thru® S 301 on other life-history endpoints linked with reproduction, namely reproduction investment and hatching success. We found a significant decline of recovered springtails at soil concentrations of Break-Thru® S 301 down to 2 mg/kg in sandy soils when using flotation. However, using heat extraction no effects were found at the same concentrations. Also, reproduction investment and hatching success did not indicate any toxicity of Break-Thru® S 301 to springtails at all. In conclusion, Break-Thru® S 301 reduced the water surface tension in the flotation process so that springtail juveniles just sank and disappeared from the water surface. This artefact potentially can occur for all surfactants tested this way. We propose testing surfactant's impact on springtail flotation by adding a few drops of surfactant and observing springtails' sinking behaviour, before testing toxicity. Alternatively, heat extraction or surfactant controls can be applied. Most importantly, these options should be mentioned in the respective guidelines, which are highly relevant for chemical risk assessment.
39999018	Content Hubs, Information Flows, And Reactions for Pesticide-Related Discussions On Twitter.	Pesticides are essential in modern agriculture for controlling pests and enhancing food production. However, concerns about their human and environmental health impacts have broadened discussions on their use, regulation, ethics, and sustainability. Scientific research, media coverage, input from corporations, governments, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) shape public opinions and potentially influence regulatory decisions. This project analyzed pesticide-related discussions on Twitter/X from 2013 to 2022, focusing on information influence and propagation among individuals and organizations, advancing over prior research that looked at topic frequency, trends, and geography. Using a validated snowball sampling method, we collected over 3 million tweets from 1 million users and identified key network influencers, ie, information hubs, analyzing their content, popularity, and characteristics. Machine learning and a tailored information flow score were used to explore the dynamics of information flow and sentiment across hubs. Our analysis revealed that organizational hubs, particularly NGOs and media, were more active and had higher follower-to-following ratios than individual influencers. NGOs and media also dominated the pesticide-related discourse, while individual influencers had a lesser role. Information sources were unevenly distributed, with a dominance of retweets, news, and media posts, and a low prevalence of scientific sources. Information flow was high through NGOs, academia, and individuals, but poor from government accounts. Pesticide-focused hubs were more active and targeted in their information dissemination, with public sentiment largely negative. By delving deeper into the dynamics of information dissemination and influence networks, this study provides insights that emphasize 1) the need for better communication strategies to integrate diverse stakeholder perceptions and values, and 2) prioritizing the dissemination of credible scientific information, while also addressing sectoral disparities. Together, they can help policymakers and industry stakeholders build trust, promote transparency, and advance sustainable pesticide regulation.
39998963	Chlorantraniliprole as seed treatments against the black cutworm Agrotis ipsilon (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) via residues in cotton ecosystem and the exposure risks to honeybees as measured in pollen.	The black cutworm Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) can damage the cotton seedlings and induce destructive yield loss. Seed coating with systemic insecticides is a cost-effective alternative to control A. ipsilon during the early stage of cotton, but the control efficacy and exposure risk to honeybees remain unclear. This study evaluated the control effects of the anthranilic diamide insecticide chlorantraniliprole on A. ipsilon in cotton crops and the corresponding exposure risks to honeybees. Field studies revealed the control efficacy of chlorantraniliprole at 2 or 4 g/kg seed was greater than 75%, which was comparable to its spray control during the seedling development stage. A residual toxicity trial revealed that chlorantraniliprole treatment had a dose-response control effect on A. ipsilon during the 19 days after sowing. The residue levels of chlorantraniliprole in the stem bases and soil were found consistent with the residual toxicity against A. ipsilon. In the cotton flowering period, the highest detection frequency and residue of chlorantraniliprole were found in pollen from the plots treated with 4 g/kg seed. By using 2 independent risk assessment approaches, the exposure risk of chlorantraniliprole seed treatments were evaluated to be acceptable to honeybees. Overall, chlorantraniliprole coated with 2 g/kg seed was an effective alternative for controlling A. ipsilon at the cotton seedling stages.
39998841	Novel Insights into the Control of <i>Sitophilus zeamais</i> in Grain by Chitosan-Nanoparticle-Contained ds<i>SzCOX</i>.	<i>Sitophilus zeamais</i> is a highly destructive pest of stored grains worldwide. To develop novel RNA insecticides, the double-stranded RNA of <i>S. zeamais</i> cytochrome c oxidase (ds<i>SzCOX</i>s: ds<i>SzCOX</i>I, ds<i>SzCOX</i>II, and ds<i>SzCOX</i>III) was successfully expressed in the pET28a-BL21(DE3)-RNaseIII<sup>-</sup> system and remarkably downregulated the expression level of <i>SzCOX</i>s in <i>S. zeamais</i> through injection or feeding methods, leading to high mortalities in both larvae and adults. Under their optimal expression conditions (isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, 0.6 mM), the yields of ds<i>SzCOX</i>I (at 28 °C for 4 h), ds<i>SzCOX</i>II (at 37 °C for 6 h), and ds<i>SzCOX</i>III (at 37 °C for 6 h) were 8.49, 5.80, and 6.04 μg/mL respectively. The chitosan-based gene delivery system composed of ds<i>SzCOX</i>s (CS@ds<i>SzCOX</i>s) was established for the insecticidal effect of <i>S. zeamais</i> adults via mixing wheat seeds, with the mortality reaching 50% on day ten. Consequently, this nanoparticle-mediated gene delivery system is expected to be an effective approach for <i>S. zeamais</i> control.
39998101	The Proteolytic Activation, Toxic Effects, and Midgut Histopathology of the <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> Cry1Ia Protoxin in <i>Rhynchophorus ferrugineus</i> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).	The red palm weevil (RPW; Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a destructive pest affecting palms worldwide, capable of causing significant economic losses and ecological damage in managed palm ecosystems. Current management heavily relies on synthetic insecticides, but their overuse fosters resistance. <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) offers a promising alternative, producing toxins selective against various insect orders, including Coleoptera. However, no specific Bt toxin has yet been identified for RPW. This study investigates the toxicity against RPW larvae of the Bt Cry1Ia protoxin, known for its dual activity against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. A laboratory RPW colony was reared for two generations, ensuring a reliable insect source for bioassays. Cry1Ia was expressed as a 6xHis-tagged fusion protein in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and purified using nickel affinity. Incubation with RPW larval gut proteases for 24 h produced a stable core of ~65 kDa. Diet-incorporation bioassays revealed high Cry1Ia toxicity in neonate larvae. In contrast, the lepidopteran-active Cry1Ac protoxin, used as a robust negative control, was completely degraded after 24 h of in vitro proteolysis and showed no toxicity in bioassays. Cry1Ia-fed larvae exhibited significant midgut cell damage, characteristic of Bt intoxication. These findings highlight Cry1Ia's strong potential for integration into RPW management programs.
39998085	Biocontrol Activity of New Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolates Against Fusaria and <i>Fusarium</i> Mycotoxins.	As significant fungal pathogens of crops, Fusaria species contaminate various food and feed commodities. Some of the <i>Fusarium</i> spp. secondary metabolites (e.g., trichothecenes, zearalenone, and fumonisins) are widely known toxic molecules (mycotoxins) with chronic and acute effects on humans and animals. The growing demand for safer, pesticide-free food drives us to increase biological control during crop growing. Recent research suggests that lactic acid bacteria (LABs) as biocontrol are the best choice for extenuating <i>Fusarium</i> mycotoxins. Newly isolated LABs were tested as antifungal agents against <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i>, <i>F. graminearum</i>, and <i>F. oxysporum</i>. The characterized and genetically identified LABs belonged to <i>Limosilactobacillus fermentum</i> (SD4) and <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> (FCW4 and CB2) species. All tested LABs and their cell-free culture supernatants showed antagonism on the MRS solid medium. The antifungal activity was also demonstrated on surface-sterilized wheat and peanuts. The germination test of corn kernels proved that the LAB strains SD4 and FCW4 significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) enhanced root and shoot development in plantlets while simultaneously suppressing the outgrowth of <i>F. verticillioides</i>. Small-scale corn silage fermentation revealed the significant effects of SD4 supplementation (decreased zearalenone, lower mold count, and total reduction of deoxynivalenol) within the mixed populations.
39998084	Distinct Impact of Processing on Cross-Order Cry1I Insecticidal Activity.	The insecticidal Cry proteins from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> are used in biopesticides or transgenic crops for pest control. The Cry1I protein family has unique characteristics of being produced during the vegetative rather than sporulation phase, its protoxins forming dimers in solution, and exhibiting dual toxicity against lepidopteran and coleopteran pests. The Cry1Ia protoxin undergoes sequential proteolysis from the N- and C-terminal ends, producing intermediate forms with insecticidal activity, while in some cases, the fully processed toxin is inactive. We investigated the oligomerization and toxicity of Cry1Ia intermediate forms generated through trypsinization (T-Int) and larval gut fluid (GF-Int) treatments, as well as the fully trypsinized protein (toxin). Heterologously expressed intermediate forms assembled into oligomers and showed similar toxicity to Cry1Ia protoxin against <i>Ostrinia nubilalis</i> (European corn borer) larvae, while the toxin form was ~30 times less toxic. In contrast, bioassays with <i>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</i> (Colorado potato beetle) larvae did not show significant differences in toxicity among Cry1Ia protoxin, T-Int, GF-Int, and fully processed toxin. These results suggest that the Cry1I mode of action differs by insect order, with N-terminal cleavage affecting toxicity against lepidopteran but not coleopteran larvae. This knowledge is essential for designing pest control strategies using Cry1I insecticidal proteins.
39998066	Detoxification of Ustiloxin A Through Oxidative Deamination and Decarboxylation by Endophytic Fungus <i>Petriella setifera</i>.	Ustiloxins are a group of cyclopeptide mycotoxins produced by rice false smut pathogen <i>Villosiclava virens</i> (anamorph: <i>Ustilaginoidea virens</i>) which seriously threaten the safety production of rice and the health of humans and livestock. Ustiloxin A, accounting for 60% of the total ustiloxins, is the main toxic component. Biotransformation, a process of modifying the functional groups of compounds by means of regio- or stereo-specific reactions catalyzed by the enzymes produced by organisms, has been considered as an efficient way to detoxify mycotoxins. In this study, the endophytic fungus <i>Petriella setifera</i> Nitaf10 was found to be able to detoxify ustiloxin A through biotransformation. Two transformed products were obtained by using the cell-free extract (CFE) containing intracellular enzymes of <i>P. setifera</i> Nitaf10. They were structurally characterized as novel ustiloxin analogs named ustiloxins A1 (<b>1</b>) and A2 (<b>2</b>) by analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS spectra as well as by comparison with known ustiloxins. The cytotoxic activity of ustiloxins A1 (<b>1</b>) and A2 (<b>2</b>) was much weaker than that of ustiloxin A. The biotransformation of ustiloxin A was found to proceed via oxidative deamination and decarboxylation and was possibly catalyzed by the intracellular amine oxidase and oxidative decarboxylase in the CFE. An appropriate bioconversion was achieved by incubating ustiloxin A with the CFE prepared in 0.5 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 24 to 48 h. The optimum initial pH values for the bioconversion of ustiloxin A were 7-9. Among eight metal ions (Co<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>) tested at 5 mmol/L, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> totally inhibited the conversion of ustiloxin A. In conclusion, detoxification of ustiloxin A through oxidative deamination and decarboxylation is an efficient strategy.
39997957	Effects of Environmental Chemical Pollutants on Microbiome Diversity: Insights from Shotgun Metagenomics.	Chemical exposure in the environment can adversely affect the biodiversity of living organisms, particularly when persistent chemicals accumulate over time and disrupt the balance of microbial populations. In this study, we examined how chemical contaminants influence microorganisms in sediment and overlaying water samples collected from the Kinnickinnic, Milwaukee, and Menomonee Rivers near Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. We characterized these samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing to assess microbiome diversity and employed chemical analyses to quantify more than 200 compounds spanning 16 broad classes, including pesticides, industrial products, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals. Integrative and differential comparative analyses of the combined datasets revealed that microbial density, approximated by adjusted total sequence reads, declined with increasing total chemical concentrations. Protozoan, metazoan, and fungal populations were negatively correlated with higher chemical concentrations, whereas certain bacterial (particularly Proteobacteria) and archaeal populations showed positive correlations. As expected, sediment samples exhibited higher concentrations and a wider dynamic range of chemicals compared to water samples. Varying levels of chemical contamination appeared to shape the distribution of microbial taxa, with some bacterial, metazoan, and protozoan populations present only at certain sites or in specific sample types (sediment versus water). These findings suggest that microbial diversity may be linked to both the type and concentration of chemicals present. Additionally, this study demonstrates the potential roles of multiple microbial kingdoms in degrading environmental pollutants, emphasizing the metabolic versatility of bacteria and archaea in processing complex contaminants such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and bisphenols. Through functional and resistance gene profiling, we observed that multi-kingdom microbial consortia-including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa-can contribute to bioremediation strategies and help restore ecological balance in contaminated ecosystems. This approach may also serve as a valuable proxy for assessing the types and levels of chemical pollutants, as well as their effects on biodiversity.
39997943	Acute Toxicity, Neurotoxic, Immunotoxic, and Behavioral Effects of Deltamethrin and Sulfamethoxazole in Adult Zebrafish: Insights into Chemical Interactions and Environmental Implications.	The increasing presence of antimicrobial agents and pesticides in aquatic environments raises concerns about their potential impacts on non-target organisms. Among these chemicals, deltamethrin (DM), a widely used pesticide, and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), an antimicrobial commonly detected in water bodies, pose significant ecological risks. This study investigates the acute toxicity, neurotoxic effects, oxidative stress responses, immune-related gene expression, and feeding behavior of adult zebrafish exposed to DM and SMX. The 96 h LC<sub>50</sub> for DM was 4.84 µg/L, indicating significant acute toxicity, while the LC<sub>50</sub> for the DM + SMX mixture was 11.32 µg/L, suggesting that SMX may mitigate the toxicity of DM. Neurotransmitter alterations, including reduced levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (γ-GABA), serotonin (5-HT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), were observed, with the combination of DM and SMX showing partial restoration of AChE activity. Oxidative stress markers revealed significant changes in antioxidant enzyme activities, with DM exposure increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, while decreasing catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities. Immune-related gene expression demonstrated suppressed IgM, IgD, and IgZ levels, along with altered inflammatory responses, with both DM and DM + SMX exposure inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Finally, feeding behavior was significantly impaired in the DM group at the 3 min mark, while the DM + SMX group showed partial mitigation of this effect. These findings highlight the neurotoxic, immunotoxic, and behavioral effects of DM and SMX, and underscore the potential for chemical interactions to modulate toxicity in aquatic organisms.
39997940	Developmental Toxicity and Cardiotoxicity of N, N-Dimethylaniline in Zebrafish Embryos.	N, N-Dimethylaniline is an important chemical intermediate and an important metabolite of the pesticide Fenaminosulf. It is widely used in chemical production, but there is an extreme paucity of environmental risk assessments for N, N-dimethylaniline.: In this study, the cardiotoxicity of continuous exposure to N, N-dimethylaniline (20, 40, and 80 μg/mL) for 72 h was evaluated using zebrafish embryos.: The study found that N, N-dimethylaniline not only exhibits developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryos, leading to abnormalities such as pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, and spinal curvature, but also induces oxidative stress, lipid accumulation, and apoptosis, particularly affecting the heart region. Cardiac function indicators such as pericardial area, sinus venosus (SV) and bulbar artery (BA) distance, heart rate, and red blood cell (RBC) rate were all significantly altered due to exposure to N, N-dimethylaniline, with impaired cardiac morphology and structure and the downregulation of gene expression related to heart development and function (<i>myl7</i>, <i>vmhc</i>, <i>myh6</i>, <i>bmp4</i>, <i>tbx2b</i>, and <i>has2</i>).: The research findings suggest that the heart may be the potential target organ for the toxic effects of N, N-dimethylaniline, providing a scientific basis for the rational use of this compound and environmental protection. Furthermore, it enhances public awareness of the safety of substances that may degrade to produce N, N-dimethylaniline during their use.
39997933	Comprehensive Cross-Sectional Study of the Triglyceride Glucose Index, Organophosphate Pesticide Exposure, and Cardiovascular Diseases: A Machine Learning Integrated Approach.	Using NHANES data from 2003 to 2008, 2011 to 2012, and 2015 to 2020, we examined the relationship between urinary organophosphate pesticide (OPP) metabolites and the triglyceride glucose (TyG) index. The TyG index evaluates insulin resistance, a crucial factor in metabolic diseases. Linear regression analyzed urinary metabolites in relation to the TyG index and OPPs. An RCS (restricted cubic spline) model explored the nonlinear relationship of a single OPP metabolite to TyG. A weighted quantile regression and quantile-based g-computation assessed the impact of combined OPP exposure on the TyG index. XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, logistic regression, and SHapley Additive exPlanations models investigated the impact of OPPs on the TyG index and cardiovascular disease. Network toxicology identified CVD targets associated with OPPs. This study included 4429 participants based on specific criteria. Linear regression analysis indicated that diethyl thiophosphate was positively correlated with the TyG index. The positive correlation between OPP metabolites and the TyG index at low to moderate concentrations was confirmed by WQS and QGC analyses. The machine learning results aligned with traditional statistical findings. Network toxicology identified PTGS3, PPARG, HSP40AA1, and CXCL8 as targets influenced by OPPs. OPP exposure influences IR and cardiometabolic health, highlighting the importance of public health prevention.
39997929	Epigenetic Biomarkers Driven by Environmental Toxins Associated with Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in the United States: A Systematic Review.	Environmental toxins and epigenetic changes have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This paper aimed to (i) identify environmental toxins associated with AD, PD, and ALS, (ii) locate potential industrial sources of toxins in the United States (U.S.), and (iii) assess epigenetic changes driven by exposure to toxins reported by patients. Environmental factors and epigenetic biomarkers of neurodegeneration were compiled from 69 studies in the literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and geographic information system approaches. Some 127 environmental toxins have been associated or putatively associated with AD, PD, or ALS, with four toxic metals (As, Cd, Mn, and Hg) common to all three of these neurodegenerative diseases. Environmental toxins associated with epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation) in patients include air pollutants, metals, and organic chemicals (e.g., pesticides, mycotoxins, and cyanotoxins). Geographic analysis showed that study locations (e.g., U.S., Europe, and East Asia) were selected by researchers based on convenience of access rather than exposure risk and disease prevalence. We conclude that several toxins and epigenetic markers shared among neurodegenerative diseases could serve as attractive future targets guiding environmental quality improvements and aiding in early disease detection.
39997919	New Methodologies and Techniques for Biomonitoring Pesticide Exposure in Agricultural Workers: A Systematic Review.	Biomonitoring allows for the assessment of internal exposure to various pesticides and metabolites. Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review aims to summarise innovative biomonitoring techniques for assessing pesticide exposure in agricultural workers, their advantages and limitations, and their applicability. The search of the Medline/PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science databases identified 14 articles dealing with new techniques for biomonitoring pesticide exposure in agricultural workers. These new methodologies have identified several biomarkers associated with exposure to organophosphates. Most of the included studies combine and/or improve traditional methods to overcome their limitations. This leads to more sensitive, specific, and precise techniques with lower detection and quantification limits. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly analyse and test new biomonitoring methods for assessing pesticide exposure. These techniques can complement qualitative risk assessments and aid in developing strategies to protect public health and the environment.
39997908	<i>Salvia connivens</i> Methanolic Extract Against <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> and <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> and Its Effect on <i>Poecilia reticulata</i> and <i>Danio rerio</i>.	<i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and <i>Tenebrio molitor</i> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) are two prominent pests of maize and its stored grains, respectively. Botanical pesticides have been proposed as an alternative for their management. This study evaluated the insecticidal activity of <i>Salvia connivens</i> (Lamiaceae) methanolic extract and rosmarinic acid against <i>S. frugiperda</i> and <i>T. molitor</i> by adding them to an artificial diet, as well as their ecotoxicological effects on <i>Poecilia reticulata</i> (Cyprinodontiformes: Poeciliidae) and <i>Danio rerio</i> (Cypriniformes: Danionidae) through acute toxicity tests. The methanolic extract showed higher mortality activity against <i>S. frugiperda</i> (LC<sub>50</sub> = 874.28 ppm) than against <i>T. molitor</i> (LC<sub>50</sub> = 1856.94 ppm) and was non-toxic to fish. Rosmarinic acid, the most abundant compound in the extract (80.45 mg g<sup>-1</sup>), showed higher activity against <i>S. frugiperda</i> (LC<sub>50</sub> = 176.81 ppm). This compound did not cause a toxic effect on adult <i>P. reticulata</i> at the tested concentrations. However, in <i>P. reticulata</i> fingerlings and <i>D. rerio</i> adults, it was non-toxic, except in <i>D. rerio</i> embryos, where it was slightly toxic. These findings suggest that <i>S. connivens</i> methanolic extract has potential as a botanical product for the management of <i>S. frugiperda</i> and <i>T. molitor</i> with low ecotoxicological impact, while rosmarinic acid may be a useful compound for the management of <i>S. frugiperda</i>.
39997904	Sicurpest: A Prototype of a User-Friendly Tool for Preventive Risk Assessment of Pesticide Use in Agriculture.	In recent years, there has been a significant increase in attention towards the use of pesticides, as evidenced by the introduction of regulations aimed at ensuring their safe and environmentally responsible application. Although this stricter legislative framework offers potential benefits, the challenges faced by farmers, particularly those in small-scale operations, in complying with occupational health and safety (OHS) requirements are considerable. To address this issue, a research project was promoted by the Italian Workers' Compensation Authority (INAIL) aimed at developing a user-friendly software tool to support farmers in planning pesticide applications in safe conditions. This study summarizes the results of the research, which consisted of three main phases: the definition of the main parameters that characterize the farmers' exposure based on the analysis of the literature; the development of a risk assessment model that integrates these determinants with data provided by producers for each authorized pesticide; and the development of software tool (called SICURPEST) for a preliminary risk assessment when using pesticides. This tool serves as a preliminary risk assessment method, offering a simplified model for practical use by farmers. Its initial verification was conducted through a case study and the results represent a step towards promoting safer pesticide practices, providing a solid basis for further validation.
39997864	The Synthesis of Selenium Nanoparticles and Their Applications in Enhancing Plant Stress Resistance: A Review.	Nanoparticle-based strategies have emerged as transformative tools for addressing critical challenges in sustainable agriculture, offering precise modulation of plant-environment interactions through enhanced biocompatibility and stimuli-responsive delivery mechanisms. Among these innovations, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) present unique advantages due to their dual functionality as both essential micronutrient carriers and redox homeostasis modulators. Compared to conventional selenium treatments, SeNPs offer a more efficient and environmentally friendly solution for improving plant resilience while minimizing toxicity, even at low doses. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of methods for synthesizing SeNPs, including chemical reduction, green synthesis using plant extracts, and biological techniques with microbial agents. Additionally, the review discusses the effects of SeNPs on biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants, focusing on how these nanoparticles activate stress-response pathways and enhance plant immune function. The primary objective of this study is to offer theoretical insights into the application of SeNPs for addressing critical challenges in modern agriculture, such as improving crop yield and quality under stress conditions. Moreover, the research highlights the role of SeNPs in advancing sustainable agricultural practices by reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The findings underscore the transformative potential of SeNPs in crop management, contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural future.
39997438	Biocontrol of Seedborne Fungi on Small-Grained Cereals Using <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> Strain B33.	The development of biological pesticides is rapidly becoming an integral aspect of pest management in sustainable agriculture. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of <i>Bacillus halotolerans</i> strain B33 against three common seedborne fungal pathogens-<i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, <i>Alternaria alternata</i>, and <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>. B33 strain identity was determined using the 16S rRNA and <i>tuf</i> gene sequences. Commercial wheat, barley, oat, and rye seeds were artificially infected by fungal isolates and then treated with B33 overnight culture in Nutrient Broth. The obtained results indicate high efficacy against <i>F. graminearum</i> (83.55-94.38%) and <i>A. alternata</i> (85.05-96.70%), whereby the highest efficacy was noted on wheat seed and the lowest was detected on rye seed. On the other hand, B33 achieved 100% efficacy against <i>A. flavus</i> on barley, rye, and oat seeds, while being 96.24% effective against this pathogen on wheat. Principal component analysis indicated the highest treatment influence on <i>A. flavus</i>. The effect of all tested treatments on seed germination was statistically significant compared to the controls, whereby the number of germinated seeds declined as the seed infection rate increased. <i>B. halotolerans</i> strain B33 effectively managed seedborne fungal pathogens, thereby enhancing seed germination.
39997422	The Susceptibility of Two <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> Strains on Rice Pests <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> and <i>Sogatella furcifera</i>.	Entomopathogenic fungi represent a valuable natural resource with significant potential as biological agents for pest management. However, different species or strains of fungi demonstrate varying effectiveness against specific targets. In this study, we assessed the impact of two fungal strains, <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> KN801 and KN802, on the rice planthoppers <i>Ninaparvata lugens</i> and <i>Sogatella furcifera</i>, in combination with insecticides. Our findings indicate that both <i>B. bassiana</i> strains can effectively infect the nymphs and adults of <i>N. lugens</i> and <i>S. furcifera</i>, resulting in a significantly higher mortality rate compared to the control groups. Notably, the <i>B. bassiana</i> strain KN801 demonstrated greater virulence than <i>B. bassiana</i> KN802 against these pests. However, no significant differences were observed when using different concentrations of the same fungal strain (<i>B. bassiana</i> KN801 or <i>B. bassiana</i> KN802) against these targets. Additionally, both fungi showed a germination rate of over 90% after treatment when combined with several common insecticides like chlorfenapyr and dinotefuran. The combined application of <i>B. bassiana</i> with chlorfenapyr or dinotefuran could improve pest control efficacy for these two pests. This study suggests that the two <i>B. bassiana</i> strains have the potential to infect rice planthoppers <i>N. lugens</i> and <i>S. furcifera</i>, indicating their promise as agents for the control of these pests.
39997418	A Comparative Transcriptomic Study Reveals Temporal and Genotype-Specific Defense Responses to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> in Grapevine.	Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), a globally significant crop, is highly susceptible to <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, the causative agent of gray mold disease. This study investigates transcriptomic responses to <i>B. cinerea</i> in tolerant and susceptible grapevine genotypes using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at three time points (T1, T2, T3), highlighting both genotype-independent and genotype-specific responses. Early-stage infection (T1) revealed rapid and robust activation of defense pathways in both genotypes, though the tolerant genotype showed enhanced modulation of metabolic processes by T2, prioritizing secondary metabolism and stress adaptation over growth. In contrast, the susceptible genotype exhibited less coordinated metabolic reprogramming, with delayed or weaker activation of key defense mechanisms. Gene Ontology and KEGG analyses identified critical pathways, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis-like lignin metabolism, <i>MAPK</i> signaling, as well as candidate genes such as <i>WRKY</i> transcription factors and enzymes involved in cell wall fortification and antifungal compound biosynthesis. Genotype-specific responses emphasized metabolic flexibility as a determinant of resistance, with the tolerant genotype exhibiting superior resource allocation to defense pathways. These findings provide insights into the molecular basis of grapevine resistance to <i>B. cinerea</i>, offering potential targets for breeding or genetic engineering to enhance resilience and reduce fungicide dependency.
39997405	<i>MaNrtB</i>, a Putative Nitrate Transporter, Contributes to Stress Tolerance and Virulence in the Entomopathogenic Fungus <i>Metarhizium acridum</i>.	Nitrogen is an essential nutrient that frequently determines the growth rate of fungi. Nitrate transporter proteins (Nrts) play a crucial role in the cellular absorption of nitrate from the environment. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) have shown their potential in the biological control of pests. Thus, comprehending the mechanisms that govern the pathogenicity and stress tolerance of EPF is helpful in improving the effectiveness and practical application of these fungal biocontrol agents. In this study, we utilized homologous recombination to create <i>MaNrtB</i> deletion mutants and complementation strains. We systematically investigated the biological functions of the nitrate transporter protein gene <i>MaNrtB</i> in <i>M. acridum</i>. Our findings revealed that the disruption of <i>MaNrtB</i> resulted in delayed conidial germination without affecting conidial production. Stress tolerance assays demonstrated that the <i>MaNrtB</i> disruption strain was more vulnerable to UV-B irradiation, hyperosmotic stress, and cell wall disturbing agents, yet it exhibited increased heat resistance compared to the wild-type strain. Bioassays on the locust <i>Locusta migratoria manilensis</i> showed that the disruption of <i>MaNrtB</i> impaired the fungal virulence owing to the reduced appressorium formation on the insect cuticle and the attenuated growth in the locust hemolymph. These findings provide new perspectives for understanding the pathogenesis of EPF.
39997395	MaPac2, a Transcriptional Regulator, Is Involved in Conidiation, Stress Tolerances and Pathogenicity in <i>Metarhizium acridum</i>.	The Gti1/Pac2 protein family, which is highly conserved across fungi, is pivotal in processes such as fungal development, spore formation, protein export, toxin production, and virulence. Despite its importance, the precise functions of <i>Pac2</i> within entomopathogenic fungi have yet to be fully understood. In our study, the <i>MaPac2</i> gene from <i>M. acridum</i> was identified, and its functions were explored. Studying the domain of the protein showed that MaPac2 comprises 422 amino acids with a characteristic Gti1/Pac2 family domain (Pfam09729). Additionally, MaPac2 is predicted to have an N-terminal protein kinase A phosphorylation site and a potential cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation site, highlighting its potential regulatory roles in the fungus. Our findings indicate that the inactivation of <i>MaPac2</i> resulted in faster germination of conidia and a marked reduction in conidial production. Furthermore, stress tolerance tests revealed that the absence of <i>MaPac2</i> significantly bolstered the fungal resilience to UV-B radiation, heat shock, SDS exposure, and stresses induced by hyperosmotic conditions and oxidative challenges. Virulence assessments through bioassays indicated no substantial differences among the WT, <i>MaPac2</i>-disrupted strain, and CP strains in the topical inoculation trials. Interestingly, deletion of <i>MaPac2</i> increased the fungal virulence by intrahemocoel injection. Furthermore, we found that disruption of <i>MaPac2</i> impaired fungal cuticle penetration due to the diminished appressorium formation but increased the fungal growth in locust hemolymph. These findings provide further insights into the roles played by Gti1/Pac2 in insect pathogenic fungi.
39997366	New Standardized Procedure to Extract Glyphosate and Aminomethylphosphonic Acid from Different Matrices: A Kit for HPLC-UV Detection.	Glyphosate has been extensively used as herbicide since the early 1970s. The daily exposure limit is set at 0.3 mg/kg bw/d in Europe and 1.75 mg/kg bw/d in the USA. Among its derivatives, aminomethylphosphonic acid is the most stable and abundant. Understanding their biological effects then requires reliable methods for quantification in biological samples.
39997364	Risk Assessment Arising from the Exposure of Terrestrial Vertebrates to Soil Contamination: Learning from Field Lizards of the <i>Podarcis</i> Genus.	The soil environment has been considered capable of storing toxic substances without serious consequences for the inhabitants since plants are able to bioaccumulate pollutants without compromising their survival. The application of chemicals to increase soil productivity and the dumping of waste have worsened soil quality. Recently, following a greater awareness of the importance of monitoring the damage deriving from the consumption of contaminated crops for humans and of the protection of biodiversity, studies aimed at identifying the effects of soil contamination on terrestrial animals have increased considerably. Studies using field lizards as model organisms fit into this scenario; this research has shed light on the uptake, accumulation, and toxicity of soil pollutants on reptiles. This review summarizes data collected on lizards of the <i>Podarcis</i> genus, a group of resilient wild species capable of living in both pristine and anthropized areas; the data reveal that many of the effects recorded in lizard tissues at the molecular, biochemical, and histological levels are independent of the chemical composition of the contaminants and are mostly linked to the type of cellular response. Overall, these studies confirm <i>Podarcis</i> lizards as a good model system in ecotoxicological and cytotoxicological research, providing an accurate description of the effects of pollutants, clarifying the defense mechanisms activated in relation to different exposure routes and, finally, providing predictive information on the risks faced by other animals. Since the effects recorded in lizards have often also been observed in mammals, it can be concluded that the results obtained from studies on these animals can be translated to other terrestrial vertebrates, including mammals.
39997361	<i>Apis mellifera</i> as a Model Species to Evaluate Toxicological Effects of Fungicides Used in Vineyard Agroecosystems.	Agroecosystems provide habitats, food, and water for many pollinators and insects, but they are also heavily exposed to threats from the widespread use of pesticides and fertilizers. Managed honeybees and wild bees encounter pesticides in vineyards by collecting morning dew from vine leaves and accessing sugars from grapes, particularly during dry periods. This study assessed the toxicological effects of the commercial fungicide formulations Fantic FNCWG<sup>®</sup> and Ramedit combi<sup>®</sup>, both individually and in combination, on honeybees. Using a multi-biomarker approach, we evaluated neurotoxicity, metabolic disturbances, phase II detoxification processes, and immune system function. Our findings revealed that commercial fungicide mixtures with multiple active ingredients affect bees differently than single active compounds. Biomarker responses highlighted how these complex mixtures disrupt various enzymatic pathways; including immune function; altering critical enzyme kinetics involved in detoxification and potentially impairing essential bee functions. This study emphasizes the need for more comprehensive research into the sublethal effects of commercial pesticides, particularly those used in vineyards, which are understudied compared to pesticides used in orchards.
39996971	Sustainable and Flexible Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Transducer: Gold Nanoparticle-Bacterial Cellulose Composite for Pesticide Monitoring in Agrifood Systems.	Functionalized plasmonic nanostructure platforms are widely used for developing optical biosensors and SERS assays. In this work, we present a low-cost and scalable surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) system based on an innovative optical transducer comprising gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) embedded in nano-fibrillated bacterial cellulose (BC). The AuNPs@BC composite leverages the unique nanofibrillar architecture of bacterial cellulose, which provides a high surface area, flexibility, and uniform nanoparticle distribution, enabling the formation of numerous electromagnetic "hot spots". This structure excites localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), as demonstrated by a bulk sensitivity of 72 nm/RIU, and supports enhanced Raman signal amplification. The eco-friendly and disposable AuNPs@BC platform was tested for agrifood applications, focusing on the detection of thiram pesticide. The system achieved a detection limit of 0.24 ppm (1 µM), meeting the sensitivity requirements for regulatory compliance in food safety. A strong linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup> ≈ 0.99) was observed between the SERS peak intensity at 1370 cm<sup>-1</sup> and thiram concentrations, underscoring its potential for quantitative analysis. The combination of high sensitivity, reproducibility, and environmental sustainability makes the AuNPs@BC platform a promising solution for developing cost-effective, flexible, and portable sensors for pesticide monitoring and other biosensing applications.
39996633	Fabrication of Functional Polymers with Gradual Release of a Bioactive Precursor for Agricultural Applications.	Biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric materials and stimulus-responsive hydrogels are widely used in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, biomedical, and consumer sectors. The effectiveness of these formulations depends significantly on the appropriate selection of polymer support. Through chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, these materials can gradually release bioactive agents, enabling controlled drug release. The objective of this work is to synthesize, characterize, and apply two controlled-release polymeric systems, focusing on the release of a phyto-pharmaceutical agent (herbicide) at varying pH levels. The copolymers were synthesized via free radical polymerization in solution, utilizing tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the organic solvent and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as the initiator, without the use of a cross-linking agent. Initially, the herbicide was grafted onto the polymeric chains, and its release was subsequently tested across different pH environments in a heterogeneous phase using an ultrafiltration (UF) system. The development of these two controlled-release polymer systems aimed to measure the herbicide's release across different pH levels. The goal is to adapt these materials for agricultural use, enhancing soil quality and promoting efficient water usage in farming practices. The results indicate that the release of the herbicide from the conjugate systems exceeded 90% of the bioactive compound after 8 days at pH 10 for both systems. Furthermore, the two polymeric systems demonstrated first-order kinetics for herbicide release in aqueous solutions at different pH levels. The kinetic constant was found to be higher at pH 7 and 10 compared to pH 3. These synthetic hydrogels are recognized as functional polymers suitable for the sustained release of herbicides in agricultural applications.
39996461	Catalyst-Free Selective Synthesis of <i>E</i>-Tetrasubstituted Olefins via Tandem Reaction of 3-Acetyl-4-phenyl-1-oxaspiro[4.5]deca-3,6,9-triene-2,8-dione with Amine, C-C Bond Breakage, and Proton Transfer.	The <i>Z</i>- or <i>E</i>-selective syntheses of tetrasubstituted olefins present big challenges. Tremendous efforts are ongoing to overcome this issue, especially for acyclic structures. In this work, an <i>E</i>-stereoselective synthetic method of tetrasubstituted olefins through tandem reaction of 1,4-Michael addition of 3-acetyl-4-phenyl-1-oxaspiro[4.5]deca-3,6,9-triene-2,8-dione with amine, C-C bond breakage, and proton transfer by intermolecular hydrogen bonds was revealed with excellent atom economy and without catalysts and additives. A diverse set of <i>E</i>-tetrasubstituted olefins were obtained in 43% to 93% yields with excellent functional group tolerance for late-stage modifications of complex drug molecules. The reaction mechanism was proposed based on the deuterium-labeling experiment and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.
39996429	CDP-DAG synthases regulate plant growth and broad-spectrum disease resistance.	Phosphatidic acid (PA) functions as a cell membrane component and signaling molecule in plants. PA metabolism has multiple routes, in one of which PA is converted into cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) by CDP-DAG synthases (CDSs). <i>CDS</i> genes are highly conserved in plants. Here, we found that knock-down of the <i>CDS</i> gene enhanced the resistance of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to multiple pathogens, with a growth penalty. When <i>Arabidopsis</i> leaves were treated with chitin or flg22, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in <i>cds</i> mutants was significantly higher than that in the wild-type (WT). Similarly, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the <i>cds1cds2</i> double mutant was significantly increased compared to the WT. By integrating lipidomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics data, PA accumulation was observed in mutants <i>cds1cds2</i>, activating the jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, and increasing transcript levels of plant defense-related genes. Significant accumulation of the downstream metabolites including serotonin and 5-methoxyindole was also found, which plays important roles in plant immunity. In conclusion, our study indicated the role of CDSs in broad-spectrum disease resistance in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and that CDSs are involved in plant metabolic regulation.
39996279	Effect and Mechanism of Patchouli Alcohol for the Management of Postharvest Green Pepper Fruit Rot Caused by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>.	Green pepper, a commonly cultivated vegetable, often suffers from fruit rot caused by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>, which reduces its quality and shelf life. In this study, the antifungal activity and mechanism of patchouli alcohol (PA), which was isolated from <i>Pogostemon cablin</i> essential oil, against <i>A. alternata</i> during the storage of green peppers, were investigated. PA effectively inhibited the growth of <i>A. alternata</i> <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> assays, reduced lesion areas, and extended the storage life of green peppers. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that PA induced significant morphological deformations in <i>A. alternata</i> hyphae, inhibited spore germination, and disrupted the cellular structures. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and physiological analyses suggested that PA impaired cell membrane synthesis and function, disrupted mitochondrial activity, and induced oxidative stress, resulting in cellular dysfunction and apoptosis. These actions significantly suppressed <i>A. alternata</i> growth, ultimately prolonging the shelf life of the green peppers. This study provides the potential use of PA for green pepper preservation.
39996249	Evaluation of novel fungicides (FRAC groups 7, 9, 12) for managing cranberry fruit rot.	Cranberry fruit rot (CFR) is a major disease complex that significantly impacts cranberry crops, leading to substantial yield losses. Over the past decade, CFR has become increasingly problematic, particularly in high-yielding and newer cultivars, with reported losses ranging from 50% to 100%. Additionally, the cranberry industry faces increasing restrictions on the use of broad-spectrum fungicides, such as chlorothalonil and mancozeb, necessitating the exploration of alternative management strategies. This study, conducted from 2021 to 2024 at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst Cranberry Station, evaluated novel fungicides from FRAC Groups 7, 9, and 12. The active ingredients-benzovindiflupyr, pydiflumetofen, cyprodinil, and fludioxonil-were tested individually and in combination with azoxystrobin (FRAC 11). The efficacy of these fungicides in reducing CFR incidence and improving yield was assessed on cranberry cultivars 'Demoranville', 'Ben Lear,' and 'Stevens' with applications made at early, mid, and late bloom stages. Significant differences in fruit rot incidence and yield were observed in 2021, 2023 and 2024. Treatments containing pydiflumetofen, pydiflumetofen & fludioxonil, and benzovindiflupyr, when applied in combination with azoxystrobin, consistently resulted in lower rot incidence and higher yields. The treatment containing cyprodinil & fludioxonil plus azoxystrobin, tested only in 2021, also resulted in lower rot incidence and higher yield. These findings highlight the potential of novel fungicides from FRAC Groups 7, 9, and 12 as effective alternatives for CFR management. Their use could diversify the CFR management toolkit, mitigate fungicide resistance, and reduce environmental impacts, addressing the challenges posed by increasing fungicide regulations.
39996113	Exploring the potential role of EPSPS mutations for enhanced glyphosate resistance in <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>.	Glyphosate is a widely used non-selective, broad-spectrum, systemic herbicide by interfering with the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. However, the emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds has driven the need for enhanced herbicide resistance in crops. In this study, we engineered two mutant variants of the tobacco EPSPS gene through amino acid substitution (TIPS-NtEPSPS and P180S-NtEPSPS). These mutated <i>EPSPS</i> genes were overexpressed in tobacco under the control of CaMV35S promoters. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of TIPS-NtEPSPS significantly enhances glyphosate tolerance, allowing plants to withstand up to four times the recommended dose without compromising their fitness. This research highlights the potential of the TIPS-NtEPSPS mutant to improve herbicide resistance in tobacco, offering a viable approach for effective weed management.
39996041	Understanding the impact of triazoles on female fertility and embryo development: Mechanisms and implications.	Triazoles are among the most widely used fungicides that were launched in 1980s and are one of the most important pesticide groups used in agriculture as plant growth regulators and stress protectors. Triazoles are also frequently used in the pharmaceutical industry to treat fungal and bacterial infections as well as to treat and prevent some forms of pneumonia. Humans are normally exposed to triazoles through food, water, and medications, which raises concerns about their potential adverse effects on health. Therefore, this review was planned to examine the impact of triazole fungicides on female fertility, as well as their teratogenic and embryotoxic effects. Various search engines such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Elsevier, IEEE were used to search the relevant articles published between 2006 and 2024 using the following keywords: "azoles," "female infertility," "reproductive toxicity," "teratogenicity," "triazoles," and "embryo toxicity." The findings suggest that triazoles might negatively affect female fertility and embryonic development through multiple mechanisms including inhibition or interference with key enzymes such as CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 (aromatase) involved in steroid hormone synthesis, endocrine disruption, oxidative stress, disruption of signaling pathways, and apoptosis. This review consolidates current knowledge on the teratogenic and embryotoxic properties of triazole fungicides, providing a comprehensive understanding of their health implications and addressing critical research gaps.
39995999	Cadmium toxicity on communities of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms.	The oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, which constitutes the initial and rate-limiting step in the nitrification process, plays a pivotal role in the transformation of ammonia within soil ecosystems. Due to its susceptibility to a range of pollutants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, nitrification serves as a valuable indicator in the risk assessment of chemical contaminants in soil environments. Here, we analyzed the effects of cadmium (Cd) treatment on soil potential nitrification rate (PNR), and the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities. The results showed that, under 1 day incubation, the soil PNR with Cd 0.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> was a little higher but not statistically significant than that with zero mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Then, the soil PNR increased with the increasing Cd concentration from 0.5 to one mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, and continuously declined from 1 to 10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, we predicted the bacterial functions of samples with hormetic Cd dose (one mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) by PICURSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities Reconstruction of Unobserved States), and found that the expression of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) increased with the hormetic Cd dose. PDI is known to enhance the activity of compounds containing -SH or -S-S which can help prevent oxidative damage to membranes. The soil PNR was significantly correlated with AOA abundance rather than AOB, even the abundance of AOB was higher than that of AOA, indicating that AOA functionally predominated over AOB. Our study effectively evaluated the Cd toxicity on soil microbial community and clearly illustrated the ecological niches of AOA and AOB in the agricultural soil system studied, which will be instructive for the sustainable development of agriculture.
39995877	Toxicological complexity of microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems.	Microplastics (MPs), defined as plastic debris, smaller than <5 mm, are viewed as persistent contaminants that significantly modify terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity by altering soil microbiota, structure, and functions. This paper summarizes MPs' interactions with various pollutants, including heavy metals and pesticides, also addressing socio-economic impacts, such as reduced agricultural yields and threats to regional fisheries. The study emphasizes the need for an on the basis of waste management model to mitigate these effects, advocating for collaborative efforts among stakeholders. Also, interdisciplinary studies incorporating material sciences, ecology, and environmental policy are essential to confront the challenges of MPs to ecological services. Additionally, the review highlights how MPs can serve as vectors for toxins to damage soil health and species survival. The overview underscores a complex interplay between environmental and socio-economic systems, addressing the urgency of harnessing MPs pollution and protecting ecosystem integrity and sustainability.
39995463	Chemoselective synthesis of tunable poly-functionalized binary pyrazolyl and annulated pyrazolo/pyrido anchored on quinolinone: insecticidal and antioxidant studies.	The present work is directed to synthesize new tolerance binary pyrazolylquinolinone such as pyrazolylquinolinone, 1-phenylpyrazolyl)quinolinone and 1,2,4-triazolyl)pyrazolyl)quinolinone and fused pyrazolo-/pyridoquinolinone hybrids as pyrazolo[4,3-<i>c</i>]quinolinone, benzo[<i>h</i>][1,6]naphthyridinedione, tetrahydrobenzo[<i>h</i>][1,6]naphthyridine-3-carbonitrile and 2,7-triazaindeno[4,5,6-<i>de</i>]anthracenol as prospective ingredients with the aim of assessment for their antioxidant and insecticidal potentiality. Additionally, <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> insecticidal bio-responses, cotton leafworm, <i>Spodoptera littoralis</i> (<i>S. littoralis</i>) and the cotton aphid were screened for the synthesized compounds. Interestingly, the most potent compounds were 11 and 5 with (LC<sub>50</sub> 119.79 and 164.63 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) against <i>S. littoralis</i>. Furthermore, the influence of the tested compounds on biochemical parameters, including AChE, ATPase, total protein levels, detoxifying enzymes CaE, and GST were also inspected. Furthermore, the targeted compounds showed promising antioxidant activity comparable with ascorbic acid as the presence of both of functionalized quinolinone and pyrazole moieties increasing the scavenger radical inhibition. Finally, DFT calculations were implemented to investigate the electronic and structural properties of the synthesized scaffolds.
39995045	Synthesis, antibacterial evaluation and preliminary mechanism study of novel isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives containing an acylhydrazone disulfone moiety.	Limitations in the use and availability of copper-based fungicides and antibiotics has led to a scarcity of bactericidal agents. It is urgent to develop green bactericides with new modes-of-action and effective chemotypes.
39995035	Three-Dimensional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship-Based Molecular Design through a Side Arm Strategy to Synthesize Phenylpyrazole Oxime Derivatives and Improve Their Insecticidal Activity and Photoself-Degradation.	Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) serves as one of the most important and effective tools to guide molecular design for the development of new pesticides. According to the principle of structural splicing, only changing a small group may lead to a great increase in activity while maintaining the active center unchanged. Under the guidance of 3D-QSAR, three series of phenylpyrazole oxime fluorescent insecticides acting on the GABA receptor, namely, esters (<b>POEs</b>), ethers (<b>POETs</b>), and triazoles (<b>POTs</b>), were designed through a side arm strategy and synthesized by an ultrasonic bath reaction, which were fully characterized and crystal-analyzed. The preliminary bioassay results indicated that the insecticidal activities of <b>POE</b><sub><b>12</b></sub> and <b>POT</b><sub><b>2</b></sub> against <i>Plutella xylostella</i> were 4.2 and 2.7 times higher than that of fipronil and better than that of the isolated <i>Mythimna separata</i>. Through the trend of insecticidal activity, the introduction of an aryl ring and an electron-withdrawing group in the substituted functional group of the side arm can enhance the insecticidal activity. Reversed-phase HPLC also confirmed that <b>POEs</b> and <b>POTs</b> had good lipid solubility, which was beneficial to improve their fluidity in the cell membrane. Through molecular packing, molecular docking, and Hirshfeld surface, the intermolecular interaction brought by side arms of <b>POEs</b>, <b>POETs</b>, and <b>POTs</b> and the strong interaction with GABA receptors were preliminarily verified. Photophysical tests revealed that the introduction of the side arm expanded the conjugated system and improved its light absorption and fluorescence. Under the irradiation of simulated sunlight, it was found that they had photoself-degradation and could be retransformed into the parent fragment of phenylpyrazole, thereby improving its biological activity and reducing residues.
39994881	Chromosome-level assemblies of Amaranthus palmeri, Amaranthus retroflexus, and Amaranthus hybridus allow for genomic comparisons and identification of a sex-determining region.	Amaranthus palmeri (Palmer amaranth), Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed), and Amaranthus hybridus (smooth pigweed) are troublesome weeds that are economically damaging to several cropping systems. Collectively referred to as "pigweeds," these species are incredibly adaptive and have become successful competitors in diverse agricultural settings. The development of genomic resources for these species promises to facilitate the elucidation of the genetic basis of traits such as biotic and abiotic stress tolerance (e.g., herbicide resistance) and sex determination. Here, we sequenced and assembled chromosome-level genomes of these three pigweeds. By combining the haplotype-resolved assembly of A. palmeri with existing restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data, we identified an approximately 2.84 Mb region on chromosome 3 of Hap1 that is male-specific and contains 37 genes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that two genes, RESTORER OF FERTILITY 1 (RF1) and TLC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN (TLC), within the male-specific region were upregulated in male individuals across the shoot apical meristem, the floral meristem, and mature flowers, indicating their potential involvement in sex determination in A. palmeri. In addition, we rigorously classified cytochrome P450 genes in all three pigweeds due to their involvement in non-target-site herbicide resistance. Finally, we identified contiguous extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) in A. palmeri, a critical component of glyphosate resistance in this species. The findings of this study advance our understanding of sex determination in A. palmeri and provide genomic resources for elucidating the genetic basis and evolutionary origins of adaptive traits within the genus.
39994719	Safety and effectiveness of triple-drug therapy with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole in reducing lymphatic filariasis prevalence and clearing circulating filarial antigens in Mombasa, Kenya.	In 2018, Kenya introduced triple-drug therapy with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, albendazole (IDA) through mass drug administration (MDA) to accelerate the elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF). This community-based surveillance study assessed the safety and effectiveness of IDA-MDA in reducing LF-antigenemia prevalence and circulating filarial antigens (CFA) clearance among LF infected individuals.
39994532	A Chinese patient with cardiogenic stroke and warfarin resistance: a case report.	Warfarin is the most commonly used oral anticoagulant drug in clinical practice due to its effective anticoagulant effect and low cost. Warfarin plays a crucial role in the anticoagulant treatment of patients with thrombotic diseases such as atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement, and deep vein thrombosis. In general, low-dose warfarin can effectively achieve the optimal international normalized ratio (INR) for patients requiring anticoagulation therapy. In some cases, patients may require significantly higher doses of warfarin to achieve an INR in the desired range; failure to achieve this is commonly referred to as warfarin resistance. We report a rare case of cerebral infarction caused by atrial fibrillation and warfarin resistance in China.
39994419	Fumigant dazomet induces tobacco plant growth via changing the rhizosphere microbial community.	After continuous cropping for many years, crops are often subject to growth inhibition, which seriously affects their yields.In agricultural production, soil fumigation can effectively alleviate the biological stress on plants. However, the relationship between the microbial groups that respond to soil fumigation changes and plants, as well as whether their existence makes a beneficial contribution to plants, remains unclear. We explored the mechanism of soil fumigation promoting plant growth by affecting microorganisms. The results showed that dazomet treatment significantly alleviated the growth retardation of tobacco, and this difference was most obvious in the flourishing period of tobacco, when the plant height and leaf area increased by 3.33 times and 3.24 times respectively. In addition, the growth advantage of the above-ground tissue was significantly correlated with the root advantage (P < 0.05). At the same time, we found that dazomet treatment significantly increased a large number of microbial groups positively related to roots, such as g_Pedobacter, g_Microbacterium and g_Brevundimonas. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that the microbial community, which was positively correlated with the amount of dazomet applied and also positively correlated with roots (P < 0.05), was an important factor contributing to the growth advantage of tobacco. Overall, the findings of this study are of great significance for enhancing our understanding of soil remediation by fumigation and may have far reaching implications for the practical application of dazomet fumigation.
39994396	Longevity of neonicotinoid seed treatments in cotton seedlings under various deficit irrigation levels.	Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of insecticides in agriculture. They are systemic insecticides mainly used as seed treatments to manage sucking insect pests in a wide range of field crops. Environment and growing conditions can impact the efficacy of neonicotinoid seed treatments. To evaluate this, an experiment was conducted to study the interactive effect of soil, water levels on the neonicotinoid concentration and plant growth in cotton. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design, with three water levels, 30%, 60%, and 100% (control) of recommended irrigation and four seed treatments, including clothianidin, thiamethoxam, imidacloprid and an untreated control. Cotton seedlings were collected and analyzed for physiological changes and neonicotinoid concentrations at 15, 30 and 45 days after germination (DAG). Data were collected on plant height, fresh biomass and leaf area. The neonicotinoid concentrations were analyzed in leaf tissues using LC-MS/MS. The 30% and 60% of recommended irrigation treatments resulted in significantly taller seedlings with greater biomass and leaf area compared to the 100% water saturation (control) treatment. Thiamethoxam-treated seedlings had greater plant height and shoot fresh mass compared to clothianidin and the untreated control, whereas imidacloprid-treated seedlings had greater leaf area than thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and control at all water levels. 30% recommended irrigation increased neonicotinoid concentrations in leaf tissues, with clothianidin showing higher levels compared to other neonicotinoids at 45 DAG. Neonicotinoid seed treatment efficacy may vary with environmental factors, impacting sustainable pest control.
39994362	Geoclimatic modeling and assessment of pesticide dynamics in Indian soil.	Although pesticides can protect crops from pests and diseases, their extensive use poses significant environmental risks through soil quality degradation and groundwater contamination. Pesticide dynamics in soil are influenced by geoclimatic factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate local variability in pesticide dynamics based on geoclimatic variation across India at the individual farm level and to identify emerging patterns of pesticide residue accumulation in the soil. Using a bioreactive transport simulator, biogeochemical models from 19,573 farms were evaluated to study the dynamics of 46 pesticides across India by incorporating farm-level data on soil and climatic conditions. Hotspots of pesticide leaching and residue accumulation were identified by analyzing several parameters, including soil texture, organic carbon content, pH, and rainfall. This study highlighted the variability in pesticide residue accumulation at the topsoil and leaching rates from topsoil to below root zone across three dimensions-time, location, and pesticide species. It also explored the statistical patterns of pesticide leaching. The average leaching ratio was estimated to be 5% of the applied pesticide mass, which aligns with previous studies reporting approximately 7%. In this study, we evaluated for the first time spatial variations of pesticide dynamics in soil by simulating geoclimatic data at the farm level, which is the smallest unit of agriculture. This opens up the possibility of data-driven pesticide management at both farm and regional levels. This research provides actionable insights for policymakers to optimize pesticide application rates across regions and for farmers to select pesticides with minimal environmental impact based on specific local conditions.
39994255	Simultaneous screening of 211 pesticide residues in date fruits in Iran and health risk assessments based on Mont Carlo simulation.	In this study, 211 pesticides were analyzed simultaneously using a QuEChERS method coupled with GC-MS-MS and LC-MS-MS in 90 fresh date fruit samples produced in Kerman Province. Probabilistic estimates of non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks were evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation-based hazard Quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk (CR). The linearity of 0.015-0.30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> with the coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) values exceeding 0.9989 were achieved. The percentage of recoveries, limits of detection (LODs), limits of quantification (LOQs), Relative standard deviation (RSD %) and matrix effect (ME) were determined in the range of 77-119%, 0.001-0.003 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.005-0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, ≤ 15% and - 7.5 to 14.2%, respectively. Among 90 analyzed date fruits, 9 samples (10%) contained at least one pesticide residue, whereas 5 samples (5.5%) showed pesticide residues exceeding maximum residual limit (MRL) according to the national and European Commission. The obtained HQ values for the target pesticides were as cypermethrin > imazalil > permethrind > endosulfan > Fenpropathrin. The HI values for adult and child consumers with all pesticide residues were lower than 1. The CR was less than 1.0E-6 value. Thus, there was no carcinogenic risk to the consumers of date fruits.
39994226	Plasmodium falciparum Pfs47 haplotype compatibility to Anopheles gambiae in Kisumu, a malaria-endemic region of Kenya.	Insecticide resistance and outdoor transmission have reduced the effectiveness of existing malaria transmission prevention strategies. As a result, targeted approaches to support continuing malaria control, such as transmission-blocking vaccines, are required. Cross-sectional mass blood screening in children between 5 and 15 years was conducted in Chulaimbo, Kisumu, during the dry and wet seasons in 2018 and 2019. Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte carriers were identified by Microscopy. Subsequently, carriers were used to feed colony bred Anopheles gambiae females in serum replacement and whole blood membrane feeding experiments. The infection prevalence was 19.7% (95% Cl 0.003-0.007) with 95% of the infections being caused by P. falciparum. Of all confirmed P. falciparum infections, 16.9% were gametocytes. Thirty-seven paired experiments showed infection rates of 0.9% and 0.5% in the serum replacement and whole blood experiments, respectively, with no significant difference (P = 0.738). Six Pfs47 haplotypes were identified from 24 sequenced infectious blood samples: Hap_1 (E27D and L240I), Hap_2 (S98T); Hap_3 (E27D); Hap_4 (L240I); Hap_5 (E188D); and Hap_6 without mutations. Haplotype 4 had the highest frequency of 29.2% followed by Hap_3 and Hap_6 at 20.8% each then Hap_1 with a frequency of 16.7%, whereas Hap_5 and Hap_2 had frequencies of 8.3% and 4.2% respectively. Varying frequencies of Pfs47 haplotypes observed from genetically heterogeneous parasite populations in endemic regions illuminates vector compatibility to refracting P. falciparum using the hypothesized lock and key analogy. This acts as a bottleneck that increases the frequency of P. falciparum haplotypes that escape elimination by vector immune responses. The interaction can be used as a potential target for transmission blocking through a refractory host.
39994093	Rapid determination of malachite green in fish by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy combined with MIL-100 (Fe).	Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was combined with stoichiometric analysis to synthesize a AuNPs@MIL-100 (Fe) SERS substrate. This high-performance, and low-cost metal-organic framework-based SERS nano sensor is capable of detecting malachite green (MG) residues in fish. The minimum detectable  concentration of MG in standard solutions is 0.1 μg/L, while in fish samples, the detection range spanned from 0.003-0.088 μg/kg. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine regression (SVR) were applied to model the SERS data, enhancing both the precision and reliability of the detection. The results show that compared with the traditional linear regression and PLSR models, the prediction accuracy of the SVR model is an  improvement with higher stability. MG standard solutions and three fish samples can  be analysed directly or after simple extraction. This method can be used to detect trace harmful substances in different aquatic products.
39993785	Prolonged Prothrombin Time due to Drug-Drug Interaction of Warfarin after the Change from Bosentan to Macitentan: A Case of Pharmacist Intervention in the Outpatient Clinic.	A woman in her 70s who was taking warfarin 3.75 mg/day had a prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) within the therapeutic range. Her medication for pulmonary hypertension was changed from bosentan to macitentan. After 40 days, she developed respiratory distress, anorexia, and vomiting caused by common cold. When she visited the pharmaceutical outpatient clinic without reservation, the pharmacist suspected that bosentan discontinuation, which cancelled cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and CYP3A4 enzyme induction, and decreased vitamin K intake due to appetite loss had enhanced warfarin effect, causing PT-INR prolongation. The pharmacist requested the physician to examine the patient's PT-INR. Results showed that her PT-INR was >7. Hence, she was urgently hospitalized. Warfarin and macitentan were discontinued, and the patient's PT-INR decreased to 1.77 after the intravenous administration of vitamin K. Her appetite improved, and warfarin 2 mg/day was resumed. Additionally, when she had been administered macitentan, her hemoglobin levels decreased from 10.8 to 6.6 mg/dL. Therefore, the pharmacist and the physician during hospitalization planned to resume treatment with bosentan, but not with macitentan. The pharmacist proposed to increase the warfarin dose to 3.75 mg since the bosentan and warfarin interaction could lower PT-INR. Thereafter, the patient's PT-INR was controlled within the therapeutic range, and her hemoglobin level was 8-9 mg/dL. The patient was discharged on day 17 of admission. Thus, pharmacist intervention plays a significant role in warfarin control with consideration of drug-drug interaction in patients receiving pulmonary hypertension treatment.
39993733	Effect of the neonicotinoid pesticide clothianidin at a no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) dose on maternal behavior in pregnant mice and their female offspring.	Our previous reports showed that exposure to the neonicotinoid pesticide clothianidin (CLO) at a no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) dose during fetal development and lactation in mice led to higher rates of maternal neglect and infanticide. Although the demonstrated association between decreased oxytocin secretion and decreased maternal parenting behavior implies a link to declining oxytocin levels, no evidence has yet emerged in CLO to clearly establish such an association. This study investigated the effects of CLO on maternal behavior and oxytocin in C57BL/6N mice exposed during pregnancy and lactation (F0 mothers) as well as in their adult female offspring (F1 mothers). The effects were assessed using nest building assays during pregnancy and pup retrieval assessment after delivery. The results showed a decrease in oxytocin secretion and a marked decrease in pup retrieval behavior among the F0 mothers in the CLO exposure group compared to those in the control group. Their offspring, the F1 mothers, showed significantly lower nest-building scores during pregnancy. In conclusion, this study is the first to examine the potential mechanisms by which CLO exposure in mothers at the NOAEL dose during pregnancy and lactation results in reduced plasma oxytocin levels, subsequently leading to a decline in maternal behaviors such as pup retrieval. Furthermore, these effects may impair maternal behaviors in the next generation, when the offspring mice become mothers.
39993683	Antimicrobial and insecticidal activity of spray dried juniper berry (Juniperus communis L.) essential oil microcapsules prepared by using gum arabic and maltodextrin.	This study was carried out to optimize spray drying conditions for juniper berry essential oil (JBEO) microencapsulation. The coating material for encapsulation was a combination of maltodextrin (MD) and gum arabic (GA). The wall material content, inlet air temperature and feed flow rate were optimized to obtain small particle size and high level of powder production, with high JBEO loading and encapsulation efficiency, small powder moisture and hygroscopicity. The optimal formulation was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and used for investigation of antimicrobial and insecticidal activities. The obtained optimal conditions for JBEO microencapsulation were inlet air temperature of 140 °C, feed flow rate of 2.43 cm<sup>3</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> and wall/core ratio of 3:1. The considerably greater JBEO oil retention was obtained by using spray dried GA compared to GA in a form of the branched polysaccharide. Microencapsulated JBEO showed antibacterial and antifungal activities at oil concentrations 1-5 %. Strong repellency against S. oryzae and A. obtectus were achieved at concentration of JBEO of 2 %, while for mortality of 65.5 % (S. oryzae) and 85.5 % (A. obtectus) after 72 h, the 5 % of JBEO were required. JBEO microencapsulation could be a promising method for the production of biopesticides to reduce the use of chemical preparations.
39993618	Early life imidacloprid and copper exposure affects the gut microbiome, metabolism, and learning ability of honey bees (Apis mellifera).	The pesticide imidacloprid and the heavy metal copper provide some degree of protection to plants, while at the same time causing varying degrees of damage to bees. However, few studies have investigated the negative effects of imidacloprid and copper exposure on newly emerged bees (young bees), especially when both are present in a mix. In this study, young bees were exposed to sterile sucrose solutions containing imidacloprid (10 μg/L, 100 μg/L), copper (10 mg/L, 50 mg/L), or a mix of both (10 μg/L + 10 mg/L) for 5 days to assess their gut system and behavior, with survival and dietary consumption recorded over 21 days. We found that imidacloprid and copper reduced honeybee survival, dietary intake, and learning ability, decreased gut microbiota diversity, and caused metabolic disruptions. Notably, the mix of imidacloprid and copper had a synergistic negative effect. Correlation analyses revealed that the honeybee gut microbiota influences bee immunity and behavior by regulating metabolic pathways related to ascorbate, tryptophan, and carbohydrates. Our results demonstrate that imidacloprid and copper, either alone or in a mix, alter young bee health through a complex mechanism of toxicity. These findings highlight imidacloprid and copper's negative effects on young honeybees, offering insights for future pesticide and heavy metal impact research.
39993525	A novel spider toxin as a selective antagonist of the Kv1 subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels through gating modulation.	Members of the voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily (Kv1) are essential for the nervous and immune systems, necessitating novel modulators and deeper insights into their structure-function relationships. While all known peptide inhibitors targeting Kv1 channels are pore blockers, we identified MrVIII (κ-HxTx-MrVIII), a novel peptide toxin from the venom of spider Macrothele raveni, as the first voltage-gating modifier antagonist with selective activity against Kv1 channels. MrVIII exhibits high-affinity inhibition of Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.5, and Kv1.6, completely suppressing their currents. By contrast, it selectively inhibits the initial activation phase of Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and Kv1.7 with lower affinity, reflecting its differential subtype modulation. Gating current analyses revealed that MrVIII stabilizes the voltage sensor of Kv1 channels in its resting state, thereby preventing activation upon depolarization. The interaction between MrVIII and Kv1.1, Kv1.4, and Kv1.7 is unstable, with the voltage sensor of Kv1.7, initially stabilized in the resting state by the toxin, potentially transitioning back to an activated state, influenced by the strength and duration of depolarization. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis identified the S3-S4 region as the critical interaction region, with the conserved residue Y339 (in Kv1.3) serving as a key binding site across subtypes. Additionally, the contribution of E283 and T286 in Kv1.1 and A256 in Kv1.7 are key residues in defining channel's pattern in inhibition by MrVIII, compared to Kv1.3. These findings establish MrVIII as a valuable molecular tool for studying Kv1 channels, offering potential pathways for drug development and therapeutic applications.
39993257	Organ-Specific Effects of Polystyrene Nanoplastics on Deltamethrin-Induced Toxicity in Mice: Mitigated Hepatorenal Oxidative Damage But Increased Enteric Toxicity.	This study investigates the combined effects of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) and deltamethrin (DEL) on mice, focusing on their different impacts among organs. Mice were exposed to PS-NPs and/or DEL for 30 days. Results showed that PS-NPs alleviated DEL-induced oxidative damage in the liver and kidney by reducing its accumulation due to decreased bioaccessibility. Conversely, PS-NPs increased DEL accumulation in the intestine, leading to enhanced susceptibility to enteric infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites, as indicated by transcriptomic analysis. PS-NPs delayed DEL excretion by reducing gastrointestinal motility, as evidenced by altered neurotransmitter levels, thereby contributing to greater intestinal accumulation of DEL. Moreover, 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that PS-NPs tended to decrease beneficial bacteria and increase pathogenic bacteria in the gut microbiota, further heightening susceptibility to enteric infections upon coexposure. The findings of this study shed new light on the complex health risks associated with coexposure to nanoplastics and pesticides.
39993238	Design, Synthesis, and Biological Activity Evaluation of Novel Phenoxypyridine Derivatives Containing Acylthiourea Fragments as Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase Inhibitor Herbicides.	Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO, EC 1.3.3.4) plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll in plants. PPO inhibitor herbicides are noted for their broad-spectrum activity, high efficiency, low toxicity, and minimal environmental impact, positioning them as effective targets for the discovery of environmentally friendly herbicides. In this research, utilizing the principles of bioisosterism and substructure activity splicing, 42 phenoxypyridine derivatives containing acylthiourea fragments were synthesized. Among them, the compound <b>g13</b> exhibited superior inhibitory efficacy against six target weed species in greenhouse herbicidal trials. In vitro enzyme activity assays indicated that <b>g13</b> significantly inhibited <i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i> PPO (<i>Ec</i>PPO), with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.109 ± 0.018 μM, demonstrating superior inhibitory activity compared to oxyfluorfen. Furthermore, compound <b>g13</b> exhibited superior crop safety compared to oxyfluorfen and holds potential application prospects for weed management in wheat and cotton. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations were employed to elucidate the binding mode and molecular mechanism of <b>g13</b> with <i>Nt</i>PPO. Potential metabolic pathways for <b>g13</b> in plant systems were also analyzed. These experimental and theoretical results indicate that <b>g13</b> is a promising lead candidate for PPO inhibitor herbicides.
39992730	New Findings from the Volatiles of the Corsican Liverwort <i>Porella arboris-vitae</i>: An Evaluation of Their Allelopathic Effect.	The volatile metabolites of the Corsican liverwort <i>Porella arboris-vitae</i> and their allelopathic implication were studied for the first time. Volatile compounds of the essential oil, hydrosol, and ether extract were investigated using gas chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Drimane and pinguisane derivatives were dominant in the plant. The study highlights an analytical strategy involving metabolite enrichment by column chromatography and comprehensive analytical experiments to identify compounds with incomplete spectral data from the literature. Among them, the drime-7-en-11-acid methyl ester hitherto described as a synthetic intermediate was described here for the first time in its natural state and a sesquiterpene alcohol was newly discovered. The allelopathic effect of <i>P. arboris-vitae</i> volatile metabolites was evaluated on two monocotyledonous species, rice and leek, and two dicotyledonous species, radish and watercress. Essential oils, hydrosols, and ether extracts inhibited the germination and seedling growth, highlighting the potential of bryophyte for developing novel herbicides.
39992706	Congenital malaria in newborns of mothers living in highly endemic parts of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.	Congenital malaria, characterised by low parasitaemia in newborns' peripheral blood, is difficult to diagnose by conventional techniques. Owing to its high sensitivity, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows for effective detection of low-density plasmodium infections. This study determined the prevalence of congenital malaria by PCR in newborns of mothers living in a malaria-endemic area of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
39992692	Monitoring Emerging Contaminants in Soil and Household Dust Samples by Non-Targeted Analysis in the Greater Miami Area, Florida.	Emerging organic contaminants are increasingly present in the environment, with several pollution sources.

39992623	Evaluation of Combined Use of Protein and Postbiotics Feed Supplements in Honey Beehives in Autumn and Spring.	Feed supplementation in beehives is a commonly necessary practice in beekeeping today, to address the many risks the honey bees face, mainly the climate change and times of food scarcity, agricultural pesticides, or pathogens such as Varroa destructor or Nosema ceranae. Protein supplements and postbiotics products have been evaluated in beehives feed, obtaining improvements of the strength and sanitary status, but they have not been tested in combination. In this study, two experiences have been carried out in autumn and spring to check the potential beneficial effect of this combination in the beehives. Two monitoring were carried out, before and after 1 month of the application of products, in order to assess the strength (number of bees, amount of brood, brood survival, and pollen/honey reserves) and sanitary status (V. destructor and N. ceranae infestation levels) of the colonies. Firstly, the results obtained in autumn experience showed a reduction of both pathogens in supplemented group. On the other hand, in spring, the combination of protein and postbiotics enhanced the brood survival and honey yield, and decreased the V. destructor infestation. Thus, the combined use of protein and postbiotics as feed supplements could be an important tool to improve the sanitary status after the cold season, and to increase the strength and production of beehives in spring, unifying the benefits of both supplements.
39992314	Repurposing tafenoquine as a potent antifungal agent against Candida haemulonii sensu stricto.	The rise in fungal infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens like Candida haemulonii sensu stricto presents a significant global health challenge. The common resistance to current treatments underscores the urgency to explore alternative therapeutic strategies, including drug repurposing.
39992285	Discovery of (+)-Methyl Nonactate as a Potential Fungicide against Gummy Stem Blight.	Gummy stem blight (GSB), which is caused by <i>Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum</i>, threatens pumpkin yields and agriculture. Effective, safe antifungal agents are urgently needed. In this study, fermentation broth supernatant of <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. NEAU-T55 demonstrated considerable antifungal activity against <i>S. cucurbitacearum</i>. Activity-guided isolation identified 2 new and 14 known compounds, with (+)-methyl nonactate (<b>10</b>) determined as the main active ingredient. This compound exhibited strong antifungal activity (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.12 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>), outperforming difenoconazole (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.17 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>), and achieved 74.1% control efficacy in the pot experiments. Microscopy revealed that (+)-methyl nonactate impeded mycelial growth and induced morphological alterations. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that (+)-methyl nonactate may inhibit acetolactate synthase, thereby disrupting amino acid metabolism and diminishing precursor availability for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This research represents the first application of (+)-methyl nonactate for GSB control and provides insights into its antifungal mechanisms, laying the groundwork for its potential development as a novel agricultural antibiotic.
39991436	Towards combining self-organizing maps (SOM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for improving model accuracy: Application to malaria vectors phenotypic resistance.	This study introduces a hybrid approach that combines unsupervised self-organizing maps (SOM) with a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance model accuracy in vector-borne disease modeling. We applied this method to predict insecticide resistance (IR) status in key malaria vectors across Africa. Our results show that the combined SOM/CNN approach is more robust than a standalone CNN model, achieving higher overall accuracy and Kappa scores among others. This confirms the potential of the SOM/CNN hybrid as an effective and reliable tool for improving model accuracy in public health applications.•The hybrid model, combining SOM and CNN, was implemented to predict IR status in malaria vectors, providing enhanced accuracy across various validation metrics.•Results indicate a notable improvement in robustness and predictive accuracy over traditional CNN models.•The combined SOM/CNN approach demonstrated higher Kappa scores and overall model accuracy.
39991206	Enhancing environmental decontamination and sustainable production through synergistic and complementary interactions of actinobacteria and fungi.	Actinobacteria and fungi are renowned for their metabolic diversity and adaptability to various environments, thus exhibiting significant potential for environmental decontamination and sustainable production. Both actinobacteria and fungi excel in producing diverse secondary metabolites and enzymes, offering valuable tools for industrial and environmental applications. Their ability to detoxify metals and degrade a wide range of organic pollutants, such as pesticides, hydrocarbons, and dyes, positions them as promising candidates for bioremediation. Recent shifts in microbiological sciences emphasize research on mixed microbial populations. Microbial interactions in mixed communities emulate natural processes and yield emergent properties such as stability, robustness, and enhanced metabolism. Co-cultures of actinobacteria and fungi harness a broader range of genes and metabolic capabilities through their distinctive interactions, opening new avenues for developing novel products and/or technologies. This review provides a critical analysis of the present status of knowledge regarding the potential of actinobacteria-fungi co-cultures with a particular focus on novel functionalities and heightened production efficiency. These consortia are promising in several fields, from environmental applications to the biosynthesis of industrially relevant metabolites and enzymes, and enhancements in agricultural production. Although challenges still exist, their potential to address complex problems has been demonstrated and deserves further investigation.
39990394	Targeted genomic surveillance of insecticide resistance in African malaria vectors.	The emergence of insecticide resistance is threatening the efforts of malaria control programmes, which rely heavily on a limited arsenal of insecticidal tools, such as insecticide-treated bed nets. Importantly, genomic surveillance of malaria vectors can provide critical, policy-relevant insights into the presence and evolution of insecticide resistance, allowing us to maintain and extend the shelf life of these interventions. Yet the complex genetic architecture of resistance, combined with resource constraints in malaria-endemic settings, have thus far precluded the widespread use of genomics in routine surveillance. Meanwhile, stakeholders in sub-Saharan Africa are moving towards locally driven, decentralised generation of genomic data, underscoring the need for standardised and robust genomics workflows. To address this need, we demonstrate an approach to targeted genomic surveillance in <i>Anopheles gambiae s.l</i> with Illumina sequencing. We target 90 genomic loci in the <i>Anopheles gambiae s.l</i> genome, including 55 resistance-associated mutations and 35 ancestry informative markers. This protocol is coupled with advanced, automated software for accurate and reproducible variant analysis. We are able to elucidate population structure and ancestry in our cohorts and accurately identify most species in the <i>An. gambiae</i> species complex. We report frequencies of variants at insecticide-resistance loci and explore the continued evolution of the pyrethroid target site, the <i>Voltage-gated sodium channel.</i> Applying the platform to a recently established colony of field-caught resistant mosquitoes (Siaya, Kenya), we identified seven independent resistance-associated variants contributing to reduced efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in East Africa. Additionally, we leverage a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to demonstrate the possibility of predicting bioassay mortality using genotypes alone. This achieved very high accuracy (73%), demonstrating the potential of targeted genomics to predictively monitor insecticide resistance. Together these tools provide a practical, scalable solution for resistance monitoring while advancing the goal of building local genomic surveillance capacity in sub-Saharan Africa.
39990226	Autophagy-enhanced nanosonosensitizer mediated sonodynamic therapy for post-myocardial infarction neuromodulation and arrhythmia prevention.	<b>Rationale:</b> Sympathetic hyperactivation and neuroinflammation are the main triggers of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) after myocardial infarction (MI). Previous studies proved that photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) could reduce MI-induced VAs by inhibiting neuroinflammation. However, the limited penetration depth and potential phototoxicity of phototherapy impose constraints on its further application. As a treatment strategy derived from phototherapy, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) offers exceptional advantages, including excellent penetration capability, temporal-spatial controllability, superior efficacy and minimal side effects. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the effects of sonodynamic modulation on neuroinflammation and arrhythmia prevention. <b>Methods:</b> We designed a long-wavelength emissive sonosensitizer (named <b>BBTD-TPA</b>) based on donor-acceptor-donor scaffold. Subsequently, the compound was encapsulated in DSPE-PEG5000 to form <b>BBTD-TPA</b> nanoparticles (NPs). <i>In vitro</i> experiments were conducted to determine the optimal concentration of <b>BBTD-TPA</b> NPs-mediated SDT and to verify the effects and pathways on autophagy in BV2 cells. The distribution and metabolism of <b>BBTD-TPA</b> NPs <i>in vivo</i> were assessed by NIR-II fluorescence imaging. Finally, <i>in vivo</i> studies were performed to assess the effect of <b>BBTD-TPA</b> NPs-mediated SDT on post-MI sympathetic neuroinflammation and the occurrence of VAs. <b>Results:</b> <i>In vitro</i> studies demonstrated that <b>BBTD-TPA</b> NPs combined with LIFU could promote microglial autophagy via the ROS-AMPK-mTOR pathway. <b>BBTD-TPA</b> NPs were further microinjected into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), real-time NIR-II fluorescence imaging showed that <b>BBTD-TPA</b> NPs could remain in the PVN for up to 12 h and be metabolized through the liver and kidney. Further <i>in vivo</i> results verified that <b>BBTD-TPA</b> NPs-mediated SDT could inhibit sympathetic nervous activity, and inflammatory responses, thus preventing MI-induced VAs. <b>Conclusion: BBTD-TPA</b> NPs-mediated SDT can promote microglial autophagy and inhibit sympathetic neuroinflammation, thus reducing MI-induced VAs. The current research may inspire a novel strategy for neuromodulation and arrhythmia prevention, providing broader prospects for clinical translation of nanomedical technology.
39989970	Malaria transmission risk in the city of Accra, Ghana: vector behavior and distribution.	<b>Background:</b> Urban malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa is often underestimated, emphasizing the need for research on vector distribution, abundance, behavior, and infectivity in cities. Since 2003, urban malaria transmission has intensified. Monitoring <i>Anopheles</i> populations is crucial for developing effective interventions. This study examined the biting and resting habits, distribution, abundance, and <i>Plasmodium</i> infection of malaria vectors in Accra. <b>Methods:</b> Adult malaria vectors were collected using human landing catch (HLC) and Prokopack aspiration (PPK) at ten sites in Accra, categorized into five groups: sites with Irrigated Urban Farming (IUF), Lower Socioeconomic Status (LS), Middle Socioeconomic Status (MS), High Socioeconomic Status (HS), and Peri-urban (PU) areas. Biting patterns and entomological transmission indices of <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. were assessed, Molecular methods were used to detect sporozoite infection, bloodmeal sources, vector species, and insecticide resistant mutation genes. <b>Results:</b> A total of 41,747 mosquitoes were collected. Of these, 95.49% (39,863/41,747) were host-seeking collected through human landing catch (HLC), consisting of <i>Anopheles</i> (52.54%, 20,945/39,863), <i>Culex</i> (42.00%, 16,742/39,863), <i>Aedes</i> (3.74%, 1,491/39,863), and Mansonia (1.72%, 685/39,863). The remaining 4.51% (1,884/41,747) were resting mosquitoes collected using a Procopack aspirator, comprising <i>Anopheles</i> (31.26%, 589), <i>Culex</i> (57.21%, 1,078), and <i>Aedes</i> (11.52%, 217). Overall, the irrigated urban farming (IUF) site category recorded the highest abundance of <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. (48.63%, 10,466/21,520), followed by the peri-urban (PU) site category (18.06%, 3,887/21,520), high socioeconomic (HS) site category (16.42%, 3,533/21,520), middle socioeconomic (MS) site category (13.74%, 2,956/21,520), and low socioeconomic (LS) site category (3.15%, 678/21,520) in both HLC and Procopack collections. Significantly higher mosquito biting activity was observed during the late evening (LE), the classical mosquito biting time, in both the rainy (71.45%, 11,337/15,865) and dry (72.21%, 3,658/5,066) seasons. Indoor An. gambiae s.l. had higher sporozoite infectivity (70.64%, 77/109) than outdoor mosquitoes (29.35%, 32/109) (χ² = 6.78, P = 0.009). Tuba from the IUF site had the highest sporozoite infectivity (32.11%, 35/109), with higher indoor (24.77%, 27/109) than outdoor (7.34%, 8/109) rates. <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> s.l. drives urban malaria transmission in Accra, with high human bloodmeal indices and sporozoite infectivity, especially indoors. Urban agriculture promotes vector proliferation. Targeted indoor control and management of breeding sites in IUF areas are essential to reduce transmission.
39989887	Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance daminozide.	The conclusions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authorities of the rapporteur Member State Czech Republic and co-rapporteur Member State Hungary for the pesticide active substance daminozide are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of daminozide as a plant growth regulator in ornamentals (field and greenhouse). The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are identified.
39989886	Modification of the existing maximum residue levels for oxathiapiprolin in various crops.	In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant Syngenta Crop Protection AG submitted a request to the competent national authority in France to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance oxathiapiprolin in Brussels sprouts, kales, watercresses, herbs and edible flowers (excluding basil and edible flowers). The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all the crops under assessment. The potential carry-over of residues into honey from the relevant intended uses on mellifluous crops is covered by the existing MRL in honey. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of oxathiapiprolin in plant matrices and in honey matrix at the validated limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concluded that the long-term intake of residues resulting from the intended and authorised uses of oxathiapiprolin according to the reported agricultural practices, and of residues expected in honey, is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health.
39989885	Peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance clomazone.	The conclusions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authorities of the rapporteur Member State, Denmark, and co-rapporteur Member State, Germany, for the pesticide active substance clomazone are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses of clomazone as a herbicide on potato and spring/winter oilseed rape. The reliable end points, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are identified.
39989884	Review of the methodology used for the assessment of the short-term (acute) dietary exposure to pesticide residues in food (IESTI methodology).	In accordance with the mandate under Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA reviewed the methodology used for the assessment of the short-term dietary exposure to pesticide residues currently used in the EU (also known as international estimated short-term intake (IESTI) methodology) and elaborated three alternative options for exposure calculations that would address some of the weak points of the current methodology. For more than 400 pesticide/commodity combinations, comparative calculations were performed using the current IESTI methodology and the proposed alternative calculation algorithms. This impact assessment illustrated that the food commodities currently falling under IESTI case 1, 2a, 2b and 3, respectively, would be affected to a different extent if the IESTI methodology is replaced as proposed in the alternative calculation options. In addition, EFSA performed a probabilistic exposure calculation based on monitoring data for 62 pesticides present in food products that are the main components of the diet of EU citizens. These calculations can give an indication whether the legal limits (maximum residue levels, MRLs), which have been set after they passed the acute risk assessment using the IESTI methodology, are sufficiently protective for European consumers. The calculations identified that for the majority of pesticide/population subgroups, the probability of an exposure above the acute reference dose (ARfD) was negligible. However, for a few cases, the probability of an exposure above the ARfD could not be ruled out. Nevertheless, given the conservative assumptions used in the probabilistic calculations and the absence of data to refine the exposure estimates, the current maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the selected pesticides are considered to offer a good protection for European consumers. Overall, the probabilistic exposure calculations should support further discussions at risk management level whether the level of conservatism of the revised methodology needs to increase compared with the current IESTI methodology.
39989477	Larvicidal activity of <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> strains against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> mosquitoes.	Organophosphates, carbamates and synthetic pyrethroids are commonly used in Thailand to control mosquito vectors; however, long-term use of insecticides in vector control has led to the rapid development of insecticide resistance. In this study, we screened <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> strains as biological control agents for potential toxins against mosquito larvae as an additional control tool. Preliminary bioassays conducted on 434 strains demonstrated that 41 strains (11.64%) and 14 strains (3.97%) achieved 100% mortality against <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> larvae, respectively. Three strains (JC690, JC691, and JC699) showed toxicity to both mosquito species, compared with the reference Bti strain. Strain JC691 demonstrated the highest efficacy against <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i>, with an LC<sub>50</sub> value of 6.96 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml and 1.16 × 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml, respectively. A comparison of LC<sub>50</sub> values revealed that JC691 exhibited higher efficacy against <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i> than that by Bti (Bti LC<sub>50</sub>: 8.89 × 10⁴ CFU/ml) but lower efficacy against <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (Bti LC<sub>50</sub>: 1.99 × 10³ CFU/ml). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that JC690, JC691, and JC699 are rod-shaped, have oval spores, and produce bi-pyramidal crystal proteins. Protein profile analysis using SDS-PAGE demonstrated distinct differences between these Thailand strains (JC690, JC691, and JC699) and the reference Bti strain. All three Thailand strains contained <i>cry</i>1I and <i>cry</i>2A genes, and only JC691 harbored the <i>cry</i>32 gene. Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of <i>cry</i>32 indicated that the partial sequences of <i>cry</i>32 in JC691 from Thailand were distinct from those of other <i>B. thuringiensis</i> strains from different countries. This study demonstrates the potential of JC690, JC691, and JC699 as biocontrol agents for <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and <i>Cx. quinquefasciatus</i>.
39989384	Assessing the imazethapyr herbicide-induced physio-biochemical consequences and phenol and glutathione-associated detoxification in lentil seedlings.	Lentil is an essential edible legume crop, especially for developing countries, due to the presence of high-quality proteins, fibers, essential vitamins, and mineral nutrients. The short height of this crop is often linked with a slow pace of growth, favoring the suitable space and time for weed incursion. Consequently, the developmental period during the crop growth cycle is shortened, leading to a decline in crop productivity. To control the menace of weeds and sustain the yield potential of lentils, we have evaluated the impact of imazethapyr spray on the osmotic behavior of lentil crops. Further, we have investigated the kinetics of PAL (phenylalanine ammonia lyase) and GST (glutathione-s-transferase) to elucidate the process of imazethapyr detoxification by lentil crop at the seedling stage. The results of the present study demonstrated that imazethapyr spray reduced the RWC (relative water content) in the range of 3.10-40.48% across the applied doses of 0.5 RFD (recommended field dose), 1 RFD, 1.25 RFD, 1.5 RFD, and 2 RFD, during different sampling periods from 0 HBT (hours before treatment) to 120 HAT (hours after treatment). On the other hand, proline content increased across different doses of imazethapyr and sampling hours. Proline content was highest at 2 RFD and varied in the 112.12-309.49% range during different sampling hours. Similarly, total soluble sugar content increased (18.15-151.66%) in response to varying imazethapyr doses across different sampling hours. The kinetic study of PAL and GST indicated progressive increases in the Vmax (maximum velocity) and Km (Michelis-Menten constant) of both enzymes. Vmax of PAL varied from 1.09-2.31 μmol of t-cinnamic acid produced (h-1 mg-1 protein), whereas that of GST varied from 35.59-83.33 μmol of CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) across the imazethapyr doses.
39989055	[Research progress in the engineering strains for producing double-stranded RNA].	Ensuring food security requires new green pesticides. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) pesticides trigger RNA interference by exogenous dsRNA specifically targeting pests and diseases. They can inhibit the expression of key genes in pathogens or pests, thereby achieving effective control of specific pests and diseases. DsRNA pesticides are environmentally friendly, with strong specificity and efficient gene silencing ability, while they have problems such as high production costs. Using engineering strains to produce dsRNA is a feasible strategy, whereas currently there is no cost-effective engineering strain for producing dsRNA. This article reviews the research progress and production strategies of using microorganisms to produce dsRNA, hoping to provide reference for dsRNA production.
39988736	Effects of Feeding on Insect Larvae Treated With Pesticide on the Biological and Biochemical Characteristics of Arma chinensis.	The effects of feeding on insect larvae treated with pesticide on the biological and biochemical characteristics of Arma chinensis were investigated. In the F<sub>0</sub> generation, the developmental duration and preoviposition period were shortened, the average number of eggs laid was reduced, and the net reproductive rate and mean generation time were significantly lower in the treatment group compared to those in the control group. The average number of eggs laid by the F<sub>1</sub> generation of A. chinensis was lower in the treatment group. The intrinsic rates of increase, finite rates of increase and net reproductive rates were significantly lower in the F<sub>1</sub> generation in the treatment group than those in the control group. The activities of CarE and GST were significantly induced, while the activity of AChE was inhibited in the A. chinensis in the treatment group. The activities of trypsin and THL were significantly induced in the treatment group, while the activity of LPS was not significantly changed. At the population level, Enterococcaceae were cultured only from the intestines of the A. chinensis in the treatment group. At the genus level, in addition to Serratia, Yokenella and Klebsiella, which were consistent with the control group, the genus Enterococcus was also cultured in the treatment group. When controlling P. rapae in the field, pesticides should be reasonably selected, and an appropriate time should be chosen for the release of A. chinensis to reduce the impact on natural enemies and to achieve synergistic chemical and biological control.
39988325	Subchronic Toxicity Test of Transgenic Herbicide-Tolerant Soybean ZH10-6 in Rats.	The herbicide-tolerant soybean ZH10-6 was developed by modifying the Zhonghuang 10 (ZH10) variety with the G2-EPSPS and GAT genes, conferring resistance to glyphosate. This study aimed to assess the potential health effects of ZH10-6 in Sprague-Dawley rats through a 90-day subchronic toxicity test. Seven groups of rats (n = 10/sex/group) were fed a commercial AIN93G diet or diets containing 7.5%, 15%, or 30% ZH10-6 or ZH10 soybeans. General behavior, body weight, and food consumption were monitored weekly. At the end of the study, clinical pathology, including hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and histopathology, were conducted. Throughout the study, all rats remained healthy and showed no abnormal clinical signs. Although some coagulation and serum biochemistry parameters showed statistical differences between groups, all values fell within the historical control ranges and were considered normal biological variability rather than treatment-related effects. The results indicate that ZH10-6 soybean consumption did not cause any adverse health effects in rats. These findings suggest that ZH10-6 is as safe as its nontransgenic parental variety, ZH10, with no evidence of toxicity after 90 days of exposure.
39988293	Gene × environment interaction between heterozygous deletion of the ADHD risk gene latrophilin-3 (adgrl3) and developmental deltamethrin exposure in Sprague Dawley rats.	The prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 9.8 % in U.S. children. Several variants of Latrophiln-3 (LPHN-3) are associated with ADHD. Using CRISPR/Cas9 we deleted exon 3 in rats to create a global Lphn3 knockout. These rats are hyperactive, startle hyper-reactive, impulsive, and have impaired working, spatial, and egocentric learning and memory. Deltamethrin (DLM) is a widely used pyrethroid insecticide. Several epidemiological studies report an increase in ADHD prevalence in children exposed to pyrethroids. Developmental exposure to DLM in rats results in multiple behavioral deficits. The present experiment tested whether Lphn3 disruption interacts with developmental DLM exposure. Because Lphn3<sup>-/-</sup> rats are severely impaired, we used Lphn3<sup>+/-</sup> (Hets) because they have an intermediate phenotype. Rats were treated by gavage once/day from postnatal day 6-20 with DLM resulting in four groups: Lphn3-Het + DLM (1.0 mg/kg), Lphn3-Het + Corn Oil (CO), Lphn3<sup>+/+</sup> (wildtype: WT) + DLM, and WT + CO. From 31 litters, 19-27 offspring per genotype per treatment per sex were obtained with not more than 1 rat of each group and sex used from any one litter. Adult offspring were tested for exploration (open-field), 72-h home-cage activity, startle, novel object recognition (NOR), radial water maze (RWM), Morris water maze (MWM), and Cincinnati water maze (CWM). On MWM acquisition trials and the reversal probe trial, Lphn3-Het-DLM rats performed worse than other groups. This group also was impaired learning the CWM. No interactions were found for open-field, home-cage, startle, NOR, or RWM. The results show that the ADHD risk gene Lphn3 in combination with developmental DLM exposure has selective adverse effects compared with either factor alone.
39988044	Primary producers in freshwater ecosystem respond differently to multiple environmental stressors: A mesocosm study.	Primary producers play key roles in maintaining a clear-water phase and promoting biodiversity in shallow aquatic ecosystems. Environmental stressors from anthropogenic activities, such as eutrophication and pesticide pollution, individually and in combination, can drive these ecosystems into a turbid state, potentially leading to a regime shift. In this 111-day study, we used 40 mesocosms (200 L) to simulate shallow lakes dominated by two typical macrophytes: the bottom-dwelling densely Vallisneria denseserrulata and the floating Spirodela polyrrhiza, along with associated food web components. We tested the interactive effects of nutrient loading, glyphosate-based herbicides, and imidacloprid insecticides on the growth of aquatic plants, phytoplankton, and periphyton. Our results indicate that meso-eutrophication, glyphosate and imidacloprid directly or indirectly affected aquatic primary producers, with the type of interaction (synergistic, antagonistic and additive) related to the form of the primary producer. Meso-eutrophication alone increased the biomass of all organisms except submerged plants, glyphosate alone decreased the biomass of all organisms except phytoplankton, with particularly strong effects on aquatic plants, and imidacloprid alone affected only aquatic animals. While combinations of multiple stressors generally increased algal biomass and decreased macrophyte biomass, submerged macrophytes consistently helped control algal blooms. These results demonstrate the risk of algal blooms in shallow lakes within agricultural landscapes and emphasize the crucial role of macrophytes in preventing algal blooms and maintaining healthy lake ecosystems.
39987801	Investigating the role of adsorbent type and ratio in mitigating 3-MCPD and GE formation during the inhibition of palm oil chemical interesterification via earth treatment.	This study examined the potential to mitigate 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol esters (3-MCPDE) and glycidyl esters (GE) during the inhibition phase of chemical interesterification in refined, bleached, and deodorized (RBD) palm olein oil. Two types of bleaching earth, natural and acid-activated, were used at concentrations ranging from 3% to 6%, and their impact on ester formation was evaluated. Chemical interesterification and adsorption treatments significantly improved oil quality and reduced ester levels (p < 0.05). Specifically, using 6% bleaching earth led to a 98.5% reduction in 3-MCPDE and a 98.3% reduction in GE. The type of bleaching earth did not significantly affect the reduction of these contaminants, while the amount of bleaching earth used played a crucial role in the mitigation.
39987735	Differing envelope composition of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria controls the adhesion and bactericidal performance of nanoscale zero-valent iron.	Zero-valent-iron (nZVI) is a candidate antimicrobial agent, and previous works revealed its varying inactivation performance on Gram-negative (G-) and Gram-positive (G+) bacteria, but the underlying mechanism remains ambiguous. Herein, we reported the easier inactivation of Escherichia coli (G-, E. coli) than Staphylococcus aureus (G+, S. aureus) by nZVI, and revealed the key role of cell-nZVI adsorption. nZVI adhered more massively on E. coli surface than on S. aureus, and subsequently led to more pronounced membrane damage of E. coli. Investigations of pH, zeta potential, and ionic strength ruled out the essential contribution of nZVI-bacteria electrostatic interaction due to the different surface charges of E. coli and S. aureus. Three-dimensional excitation emission matrix suggested that the extracellular polymeric substances of E. coli suffered more severe damage by nZVI and lead to greater exposure of membrane. Infrared spectra indicated that nZVI strongly bound with the membrane proteins of E. coli and destroyed the membrane components. By contrast, the bonding between nZVI and S. aureus was minimal because of the dominant multi-layered peptidoglycan. The enhanced nZVI adsorption and membrane disruption would result in magnified reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and oxidative stress of E. coli. Moreover, the catalase activity normalized by ROS concentration of S. aureus was 14.9-fold higher than that of E. coli after nZVI treatment, suggesting the stronger antioxidative capability of S. aureus. Our findings highlight that the different envelope compositions and antioxidant capacities between G- and G+ bacteria were responsible for their varying susceptibility to nZVI.
39987520	Assessment of the Cytotoxicity Mechanism of Diazinon on HFFF2 Cells: A Bioinformatic and Experimental Study.	Pesticide exposure can cause many skin diseases such as hypopigmentation and contact dermatitis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, Organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including Diazinon (DZN) can affect cellular pathways like ATPase, leading to mitochondrial energy deficit and even apoptosis in the cell's functions. Following cell exposure to the OP pesticide DZN through treatment, we evaluated alteration in gene expression and DNA damage. Bioinformatic analysis was performed based on the AutoDock, Protein Data Bank, STRING, Way2Drug, and Comparative Toxicogenomics databases and tools. The MTT assay, wound healing, DAPI staining, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR were applied in the current study. The results showed that the viability and migration capacity of HFFF2 cells decreased, and the apoptosis rate increased in the DZN-treated group. These findings revealed that DZN regulated the expression of the apoptotic genes in DZN cells.
39987505	Honeybee toxicity of pesticides used in United States maize and soybean production, 1998-2020.	Pesticides are widely used around the world and have demonstrated benefits to crop production. However, pesticides have also been associated with negative impacts to nontarget organisms, including pollinators. Here, we combined pesticide usage and toxicity data to create a toxicity index, which shows that pesticide hazard to honeybees (Apis mellifera) has changed substantially in U.S. maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) production between 1998 and 2020. To reduce potential risks to honeybees and increase the eco-efficiency of crop production, efforts should be made to refine management strategies for pests that contribute most to the honeybee toxicity index. In maize, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera pests drive pesticide usage most responsible for hazard to honeybees, although the relative hazard from targeting those pests has decreased over time. In soybean, hemipteran pests were the largest relative contributor to insecticide honeybee hazard. Specific pests that contributed to honeybee toxicity hazard included corn rootworm species (Diabrotica spp.), silk-eating insects, and cutworms in maize, and stink bugs (family Pentatomidae) and aphid species (Family Aphididae) in soybean. We combined crop yield data with the toxicity index to quantify the eco-efficiency, a measure of crop yield per unit of toxicity hazard. While crop yield for both maize and soybean increased steadily throughout the study period, eco-efficiency decreased in both crops between 2012 and 2020, suggesting increases in crop yield have failed to keep pace with increases in insecticide hazard to honeybees.
39987504	Functional versus compositional tests in the risk assessment of the impacts of pesticides on the soil microbiome.	The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 216 nitrogen transformation test is used to understand the impacts of plant protection products (PPPs) on the soil microbiome. However, there is significant interest in developing the European PPP risk assessment to include new technologies such as amplicon sequencing to assess impacts on soil microbial community composition and diversity. We have little understanding of how to generate endpoints from amplicon sequencing data sets, their robustness, and whether they provide an appropriate level of protection to the soil microbiome. Our study addresses this key knowledge gap. We conducted a dose-response OECD 216 study with two chemicals, nitrapyrin and streptomycin, and calculated traditional functional endpoints, in accordance with the OECD 216 guideline, and used amplicon sequencing techniques to generate a range of endpoints based on soil bacterial diversity, richness, dissimilarity from the control, species sensitivity distributions, and threshold indicator analysis. We show it is possible to generate a range of endpoints from amplicon sequencing data sets; however, these endpoints varied significantly based on the calculation method, with up to a 101-fold difference between the least and most sensitive endpoints. Additionally, the relative sensitivity of these endpoints compared to the currently used functional OECD 216 metrics was compound dependent, with many endpoint calculation methods unable to detect the impacts of nitrapyrin on the soil microbiome at concentrations deemed ecotoxicologically relevant by OECD 216. Our study shows amplicon sequencing methods to study soil microbial ecotoxicology did not perform consistently and reliably when considering both nitrapyrin and streptomycin treatments and in many cases did not consistently provide an enhanced degree of protection over the functional OECD 216 assessments already integrated into the PPP risk assessment.
39987203	Identifying malaria risks amongst forest going populations in Mondulkiri province and Kampong Speu province, Cambodia: a large cross-sectional survey.	Cambodia strives to eliminate all species of human malaria by 2025, requiring that foci among forest-exposed populations in remote settings be addressed. This study explores malaria risks amongst forest-exposed groups in Mondulkiri and Kampong Speu Provinces, Cambodia as part of a multi-stage study on novel mosquito bite prevention tools (Project BITE).
39986999	Impact of insurance coverage for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants on quality of care and care disparities in patients hospitalised with atrial fibrillation in tertiary hospitals in China: interrupted time series analysis.	To examine recent patterns regarding oral anticoagulant (OAC) use among patients hospitalised with atrial fibrillation (AF) and quantify the impact of insurance coverage for non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) on quality of care and care inequality regarding OAC use among hospitalised patients with AF.
39986789	Identification of key odorants responsible for the seaweed-like aroma quality of Shandong matcha.	The distinctive seaweed-like aroma is a typical flavor characteristic of high-grade Shandong matcha. To obtain a sample of strong seaweed aroma extracted from matcha, high-grade Shandong matcha made from fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis cv. Zhongcha 108 was steeped at 70 °C with a 1:6 tea to water ratio. A total of 11 volatile components that contribute significantly to the aroma of Shandong matcha were identified using headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry combined with olfaction (GC-O-MS). These volatile components include dimethyl sulfide (DMS), α-Ionone, hexanal, benzaldehyde, (E)-β-ionone, (E, E)-2,4-heptadienal, (Z)-2-penten-1-ol, 1-penten-3-ol, β-cyclocitral, 3-methyl butanal, Nonanal. Further aroma recombination and omission experiments reveal that DMS (P < 0.001), α-ionone (P < 0.001), hexanal (0.001 < P < 0.01), benzaldehyde (0.001 < P < 0.01), and (E)-β-ionone (0.01 < P < 0.05) are key contributors to the seaweed fragrance, with DMS and α-Ionone being the main aroma components. This study identified the key aroma compounds of seaweed-like in Shandong matcha, explored the synergistic and antagonistic effects between these aroma components, and provided a theoretical basis for the quality control and scientific brewing of Shandong matcha.
39986754	Comparative efficacy of chitosan-HPMC-based nanoencapsulation and ultrasonic treatment of thymol-cinnamaldehyde for controlling Rhizopus stolonifer in papaya: In vitro and in vivo studies.	This study examines the in vitro antifungal properties and in vivo efficacy of thymol-cinnamaldehyde (TH-CIN) loaded nanocapsules, prepared using chitosan (CH) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (H) with varying ultrasonic power (200-600 W), for controlling Rhizopus stolonifer in papaya. Ultrasonic power notably influenced the nanocapsules' antifungal properties, both in vitro and in vivo. Higher ultrasonic power resulted in improved antifungal activity, with NC-CH-400 and NC-CH-H-600 formulations achieving the highest inhibition zones (94.67 % and 93.33 %, respectively) against R. stolonifer in vitro. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for CH formulations was 6.25 mg/mL, while the Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) for all formulations was 50 mg/mL. Protein leakage assays demonstrated significant disruption of R. stolonifer cell membranes, with NC-CH-400 and NC-CH-H-600 at MFC reducing intracellular protein concentrations by over 95 %. In vivo tests showed that NC-CH-400 nanocapsule-coated papayas, whether sprayed or dipped, reduced weight loss to 0.54 % and 0.86 %, respectively, and exhibited lower decay severity indices, particularly during storage. Spraying was more effective than dipping in preventing decay. Peel color analysis revealed that coated fruits maintained acceptable ripeness levels over 10 days, indicating delayed maturation. Coated fruits also exhibited better color consistency and were preferred in sensory evaluations for improved taste, aroma, color, and texture, particularly with NC-CH-400 and NC-CH-H-600 coatings.
39986557	Ecotoxicological assessment of basil essential oil on soil nematode communities.	Intensive agriculture has over-exploited natural resources and altered the functioning of soil systems, mainly because of the abuse of synthetic products to increase yields. To improve sustainability, the European Commission has adopted the New Green Deal program, which aims to reduce the use of synthetic products by 50% and restore biodiversity by limiting human impact. Essential oils (EOs) can be sustainable alternatives to synthetic pesticides for crops and agricultural products protection against pests and diseases and, therefore, are attracting increasing interest from the scientific community. However, while most studies have focused on in vitro effects on target organisms (i.e., soil borne-phytopathogens, insects, phytoparasitic nematodes), the impact of EOs on natural soil communities remains unexplored. This study employed a field experiment using the Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) approach to investigate the potential effects of basil EO on nematode communities. Chickpea seeds were coated with a high concentration (25% v/v) of Ocimum basilicum EO in different formulations, with the basil EO and chitosan combination standing out for its potential applicability as a seed-coating treatment for future crop use. The results demonstrated that the basil EO and chitosan seed coating had no significant negative impact on nematode taxonomic diversity or functional indices. Furthermore, the taxonomic community structure-recognized as the most sensitive detection metric-revealed that the observed effects were primarily influenced by temporal changes, likely reflecting the natural progression of the crop system rather than the EO treatment itself. These findings are particularly promising, as they suggest that EO-based coatings can be compatible with maintaining soil health.
39986532	Novel point mutations M402V, M541I in the HAMP domain and L915M in the HATPase_c domain of FgOs1 confer differential resistance to fludioxonil in Fusarium graminearum.	Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum, severely affects wheat yield and quality. Fludioxonil, a phenylpyrrole fungicide, is commonly used in the control of FHB. In this study, strains with histidine kinase amino acid substitutions (M402V, M541I, L915M), conferring resistance to fludioxonil, were identified in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. Through site-directed mutagenesis and structural analysis, we found that point mutations in the HAMP domain (M402V, M541I) cause ultra-high resistance (EC<sub>50</sub> > 100 μg/mL, RF > 4000), while the L915M mutation in the HATPase_c domain results in high-resistance (100 μg/mL > EC<sub>50</sub> > 50 μg/mL, 4000 > RF > 2000). Additionally, molecular docking analysis revealed that mutations in FgOs1 (M402V, M541I, L915M) decrease binding affinity with fludioxonil, potentially altering its effectiveness. These mutations not only affect asexual and sexual reproduction but also impair pathogenicity and DON toxin production. Resistant mutants also accumulate less glycerol under osmotic or fludioxonil stress, compared to sensitive strains. No cross-resistance to fungicides with different modes of action, including phenamacril, pyraclostrobin, pydiflumetofen, carbendazim, and tebuconazole, was observed. In summary, FgOs1 mutations (M402V, M541I, L915M) modulate resistance to fludioxonil and influence asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction, virulence, and DON toxin production.
39986429	Occupational pesticide use and relative leukocyte telomere length in the biomarkers of exposure and effect in agriculture study.	Previous epidemiological studies have reported increased risks of certain cancers in relation to pesticide exposures. Although the biologic mechanisms underlying these associations are not well understood, altered telomere length has been hypothesized to play a role. We examined associations between occupational use of specific pesticides and leukocyte telomere length in the Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect in Agriculture study, a molecular epidemiological investigation of pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in leukocytes from 1539 male pesticide applicators ≥50 years of age. We evaluated lifetime use of 47 pesticides in terms of self-reported ever use and intensity-weighted lifetime days (IWLDs), a metric integrating lifetime days of use and other factors influencing exposure. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate percent difference in geometric mean RTL in relation to ever (vs. never) use, IWLDs of use, and timing of use [recent (last 12 months) and former vs. never use]. Mean RTL was significantly longer among ever users of the insecticides lindane (percent difference = 2.20%, 95%CI: 0.45%, 3.99%) and aldicarb (percent difference = 3.27%, 95%CI: 0.23%, 6.40%). Longer RTL was also associated with increasing IWLDs of lindane (highest quartile vs. never use: percent difference = 4.51%, 95%CI: -0.22%, 9.46%; p-trend = 0.048) and the insecticide diazinon (4.77%, 95%CI: 0.17%, 9.58%; p-trend = 0.055), and with recent use of the insecticide dichlorvos (vs. never use: 8.15%, 95%CI: 1.31%, 15.46%). Increasing IWLDs of the insecticide heptachlor and the herbicide 2,4,5-TP and recent use of the herbicide metolachlor were significantly associated with shorter RTL. Our findings provide novel evidence suggesting that use of certain pesticides is associated with altered leukocyte telomere length. Notably, diazinon and lindane have previously been associated with increased risks of lung and lymphoid malignancies, respectively, and longer leukocyte telomere length has been implicated in the development of these cancers.
39986419	Co-exposure to cyazofamid and polymyxin E: Variations in microbial community and antibiotic resistance in the soil-animal-plant system.	Human activity is accelerating the emergence of fungal pathogens, prompting substantial efforts to discover novel fungicides. Meanwhile, the runoff and spray drift from agricultural fields adversely affect aquatic and terrestrial nontarget organisms. However, few studies have examined the effects of co-contamination by agrochemical fungicides and pharmaceutical antibiotics on microorganisms and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the soil-animal-plant system. To further explore the mechanisms, an investigation was conducted into the individual and combined effects of a widely used fungicide (cyazofamid, CZF) and a last-resort antibiotic (colistin, polymyxin E, PME) in the soil-earthworm-tomato system. This study revealed that CZF and PME co-contamination exerted synergistic toxicity, significantly reducing earthworm survival and inhibiting tomato growth. This study found that the structure of microbial communities was more severely disturbed by the fungicide CZF than by the antibiotic PME, with the most severe impact being that of CZF + PME co-contamination. Fungicides and antibiotics had significantly distinct effects on bacterial functional pathways: CZF and CZF + PME treatments enhanced compound degradation, whereas PME treatments promoted biological nitrogen cycling. Moreover, co-contamination significantly increased the abundance of insertional and plasmid-associated genes and number of total ARGs in bulk and rhizosphere soil. In addition, the relationships between bacterial communities and the antibiotic resistome were investigated. The analysis revealed that Gram-positive bacteria (Sporosarcina, Bacillus, and Rhodococcus) capable of resistance and degradation, as well as the genes MexB (multidrug) and aadA2 (aminoglycoside) were enriched. Taken together, interactions between co-pollutants can significantly increase toxicity levels and the risk of ARG proliferation. The findings provide new insights into the potential impacts of co-contamination in complex real-life environments, such as soil-animal-plant systems.
39986418	Effects of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure in the first trimester on gestational diabetes mellitus based on interpretable machine learning.	Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy complications and seriously threatens the health of mothers and offspring. Neonicotinoids (NEOs) is a new class of pesticide and widely used worldwide. Prenatal NEOs exposure had negative effects on fetal growth, but the potential effect of NEOs exposure on pregnancy complications remain unclear.
39986406	Short communication: Evaluation of mitochondrial surface area of selected metals and pesticides in RTL-W1 cells: A high-content imaging approach.	In recent years, there has been increasing interest in utilizing fish cell culture in vitro assays, as alternatives to whole fish assays, for assessing the toxicity of aquatic pollutants. The fish cell line RTL-W1, derived from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver, was shown to retain several tissue specific features and to respond to chemical insults similarly to fish in vivo. In our study, we investigated the toxicity of two metals silver and cadmium and two pesticides azoxystrobin and paraquat using a cytotoxicity assay that measures simultaneously cell metabolic activity and cell membrane integrity. Moreover, we developed a novel 'high-content imaging' approach to evaluate if mitochondria's surface area is a sensitive and specific indicator of mitochondria toxicity. Initially, the cytotoxicity assay was used to determine the chemicals' effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>). Subsequently, we assessed the mitochondria surface area at different toxicity level (i.e., EC<sub>50</sub>, EC<sub>25</sub> and EC<sub>10</sub>) to compare the sensitivity and specificity of this method. The EC<sub>50s</sub> measured by cell metabolic activity, for silver, cadmium, azoxystrobin and paraquat were 0.71, 29.05, 2.34 and 1260 μM, respectively. Mitochondria surface area was reduced by all chemicals at the EC<sub>50</sub>, and by silver and azoxystrobin at the EC<sub>10</sub> and EC<sub>25</sub>; indicating that the latter chemicals affect mitochondria more specifically. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that mitochondrial surface area serves as a sensitive marker for chemicals inducing mitochondria toxicity in fish liver cells. Additionally, assays using RTL-W1 cells proved to be effective for detecting the hepatic cytotoxicity of environmental contaminants.
39986348	Bacillus thuringiensis-derived pesticidal proteins toxic to the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci.	The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, is among the most important threats to global agriculture and food security. In addition to losses associated with feeding, B. tabaci vectors hundreds of plant viruses, many of which cause severe disease in staple food crops. The management of B. tabaci is confounded by extensive resistance to chemical insecticides. While pesticidal proteins derived from entomopathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) could provide for alternative management approaches, only one pesticidal protein with toxicity to B. tabaci has been identified. Here we screened 11 Bt-derived pesticidal proteins from several different structural classes against the highly invasive, Middle East-Asian Minor 1 (MEAM1) cryptic species of B. tabaci, and assessed the impact of a B. tabaci-active protein on the gut epithelial membrane by transmission electron microscopy. The pesticidal proteins were expressed in Bt or in Escherichia coli and purified for use in bioassays. The toxicity of purified proteins was first assessed by feeding adults on a single dose followed by lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) determination for proteins with significant mortality relative to the buffer control. The proteins Tpp78Aa1, Tpp78Ba1, and Cry1Ca were toxic to B. tabaci with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 99, 96, and 351 µg/mL, respectively. Disruption of the brush border and severe reduction in microvilli on the gut surface caused by Tpp78Aa1 is consistent with the mode of action of Bt-derived pesticidal proteins. These proteins may provide valuable tools for the integrated management of B. tabaci populations and associated reduced incidence of B. tabaci vectored plant viral diseases.
39986238	Plant-engineered ZnO and CuO nanoparticles exhibit pesticidal activity and mitigate Fusarium infestation in soybean: A mechanistic understanding.	Herein, CuO and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were biogenically synthesized using plant (Artemisia vulgaris) extracts. The biogenic NPs were subsequently evaluated in vitro for antifungal activity (200 mg/L) against Fusarium virguliforme (FV; the cause of soybean sudden death), and for crop protection (200-500 mg/L) in FV-infested soybean. ZnONPs exhibited 3.8-, 2.5-, and 4.9 -fold greater in vitro antifungal activity, compared to Zn or Cu acetate salt, the Artemisia extract, and a commercial fungicide (Medalion Fludioxon), respectively. The corresponding CuONP values were 1.2-, 1.0-, and 2.2 -fold, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed significant morpho-anatomical damage to fungal mycelia and conidia. NP-treated FV lost their hyphal turgidity and uniformity and appeared structurally compromised. ZnONP caused shriveled and broken mycelia lacking conidia, while CuONP caused collapsed mycelia with shriveled and disfigured conidia. In soybean, 200 mg/L of both NPs enhanced growth by 13%, compared to diseased controls, in both soil and foliar exposures. Leaf SEM showed fungal colonization of different infection sites, including the glandular trichome, palisade parenchyma, and vasculature. Foliar application of ZnONP resulted in the deposition of particulate ZnO on the leaf surface and stomatal interiors, likely leading to particle and ion entry via several pathways, including ion diffusion across the cuticle/stomata. SEM also suggested that ZnO/CuO NPs trigger structural reinforcement and anatomical defense responses in both leaves and roots against fungal infection. Collectively, these findings provide important insights into novel and effective mechanisms of crop protection against fungal pathogens by plant-engineered metal oxide nanoparticles, thereby contributing to the sustainability of nano-enabled agriculture.
39985906	Colorimetric - Fluorescence - Photothermal tri-mode sensor array combining the machine learning method for the selective identification of sulfonylurea pesticides.	Though cholinesterase-based method could detect two types of pesticides (organophosphorus and carbamate), they had weak sensing on sulfonylurea pesticides. In our previous work, the peroxidase-like reaction system of nanozyme - H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> - TMB showed selective detection of sulfonylurea pesticides, but the single-signal output sensing platform was easily affected by complex matrix background, cross-contamination and human error. Therefore, this work used colorimetric, photothermal, and fluorescent signals of the nanozyme reaction as sensing units for the detection of pesticides. This is the first time that photothermal signals have been used to construct a sensor array. When the concentration of interfering substances was 25 times that of pesticides, the method was still unaffected and had excellent selectivity and anti-interference performance. Meanwhile, a concentration-independent differentiation mode was established based on the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The pesticides were detected and distinguished with 100% accuracy. This work contributed to the detection of sulfonylurea pesticides in complex environmental/food matrices, bridging the gap of existing pesticide detection methods and providing an effective method for food safety detection.
39985819	Comments and discussion concerning 'Sorption behavior of tebuconazole on microplastics: kinetics, isotherms and influencing factors' [Environ Technol. 2023;44:3937-3948].	The widespread use of synthetic polymers since the mid-twentieth century has led to significant environmental pollution from microplastics (MPs). These MPs, which persist in ecosystems, can interact with various pollutants, including pesticides such as tebuconazole (TEB). The subject paper investigates the sorption behaviour of TEB on different types of MPs (polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyamide-6), focusing on the kinetics and isotherms of these interactions. The role of metal cations (Al, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) in influencing TEB sorption is also investigated. Our findings highlight critical flaws that invalidate the original article, mainly in the interpretation of TEB physicochemical properties, such as pK<sub>a</sub> and speciation, and the importance of considering metal ion complexation in environmental risk assessment. The sorption models used by the original authors, although widely used, are questioned for their accuracy in representing real-world scenarios.
39985754	Reduced survivorship, host preference, and feeding damage by Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on cotton plants colonized by the endophyte Beauveria bassiana (Ascomycota: Hypocreales).	The GHA strain of Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) is known to establish symbiotic relationships with some plant species. The present study was developed to determine whether the foliar application of B. bassiana-GHA and B. bassiana ANT-03, another commercial B. bassiana, results in the successful colonization of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., and examine whether the endophyte can influence the survivorship and feeding damage by the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Using polymerase chain reaction, colonization success by B. bassiana-GHA, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after inoculation was estimated at 83.3%, 100%, 91.7%, and 83.3%, respectively. The colonization success based on the mycelial outgrowth method was 41.7%, 66.7%, 58.3%, and 50%, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after inoculation, respectively. Beauveria bassiana ANT-03 did not colonize cotton. Corn earworms preferred untreated plants over the neonicotinoid and B. bassiana-GHA treatments. The B. bassiana ANT-03-treated plants and controls were not distinguished from one another by the corn earworms. The corn earworm survivorship was higher on the control plants, compared to plants treated with B. bassiana ANT-03, B. bassiana-GHA, and the neonicotinoid insecticide. The neonicotinoid insecticide, B. bassiana-GHA, and B. bassiana ANT-03 reduced corn earworm damage compared to the untreated controls. Our results demonstrated the potential for B. bassiana-GHA to be used as a biological control agent against H. zea in cotton.
39985467	Novel Synthetic Method and Insecticidal Evaluation of CF<sub>3</sub>-Containing Polycyclic Neonicotinoid Derivatives.	The modification of active ingredients with a trifluoromethyl group represents a significant approach for the discovery of highly active pesticides. Herein, we developed a novel [3 + 3] annulation reaction of neonicotinoid precursors and trifluoromethyl-α,β-ynones and synthesized a series of CF<sub>3</sub>-containing polycyclic neonicotinoid derivatives in high efficiency. The insecticidal activity results indicated that most of the target compounds showed good insecticidal activities against <i>Aphis craccivora</i> and <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> at a concentration of 100 mg/L. In particular, compounds <b>3o</b> and <b>4k</b> had LC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.53 and 1.47 mg/L against <i>A. craccivora</i>, respectively, which were comparable to that of imidacloprid (LC<sub>50</sub> = 1.30 mg/L). The honeybee toxicity predictive model also indicated the potential low honeybee toxicity of target compounds <b>3o</b> and <b>4k</b>. The molecular docking study revealed that the target compounds <b>3o</b> and <b>4k</b> exhibited a favorable binding mode with the <i>Lymnaea stagnalis</i> acetylcholine-binding protein and the R55T-mutated resistant model.
39985453	EGFR in Placental Health and Disease: Pathways, Dysfunction, and Chemical Disruption.	Formation of the placenta during gestation is required to support fetal growth and development. Derived from the placenta, trophoblast cells express nuclear and membrane-bound receptors. Among these receptors is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which plays a key role in placental development. Activation of EGFR-mediated signaling in trophoblast cells regulates critical processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, invasion, and fusion during pregnancy, making it essential for normal placental formation. Dysfunction of EGFR in placental trophoblast cells has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, and preterm birth. Ubiquitous environmental chemicals, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, and bisphenols, have been reported to modulate EGFR signaling pathways, potentially contributing to placental dysfunction. This review explores the pivotal role of EGFR signaling in placental development and function, with a focus on how environmental chemicals interfere with EGFR-mediated pathways and placental cell functions as well as their implications for pregnancy outcomes. Findings presented herein underscore the need for further research into the effects of exposure to environmental chemicals on modulating EGFR signaling pathways in the context of placental health.
39985452	Effect of chlorine atoms on inhibition effect between amide herbicides and urease enzyme: molecular mechanism and structure-activity relationship.	Amide herbicides (AHs) were disturbed urease (UA) activity and soil microbial community, caused soil nutrient changes. Activity of UA was inhibited by AHs via groups of chlorine, benzene ring, peptide bond (-N-/-CO-). Difference of surface charge distribution were mainly derived from position to connected -Cl, distance of -O- from ether group and -N from peptide bond, difference of structure/length for hydrocarbon chain, and different regions of negative charge enrichment. Developmental toxicity (DT) for alachlor was strongest related to smaller structure and weaker steric hindrance effect, mutagenicity for propanil was weakest could be related to missing ether group. Molecular mechanism and structural activity relationship for inhibition of AHs and UA based on functional groups, amino acids with high frequency, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, binding area (BA) of butachlor (396.3 Å2), absolute value of binding energy (|BE|) of propanil (2.93 kJ/mol) (which as highest), quantitative structural relationship between BA and |BE|, which was negative correlation. BA for AHs and UA had negatively correlation for density with correlation coefficient (r) as -0.937 (p ≤ 0.01). |BE| for AHs and UA had positively correlation for density with r as 0.847 (p ≤ 0.05), and negatively correlation for molecular weight (MW) with r as -0.973 (p ≤ 0.001). Results provided technological support and theoretical foundation for toxic effects of SEs activity, health effects, risk regulation and control of AHs.
39985129	Applications and Challenges of Fluorescent Probes for the Detection of Pesticide Residues in Food.	In food safety, detecting pesticide residues from environmental exposure is garnering increasing global attention. Therefore, it is crucial to develop rapid and straightforward detection methods for pesticide residues. In comparison to the limitations of traditional detection techniques, fluorescent probes have become ideal tools for detecting pesticide residues in food due to their superior non-destructive detecting and real-time monitoring capabilities. In this work, first, the types of pesticides commonly found in food and the fundamental principles underlying fluorescent probe materials are introduced. Second, the characteristics, applications, advantages, and limitations of prevalent fluorescent probes for food pesticide residue detection are evaluated. Finally, the significance of fluorescent probe materials in the detection of pesticide residues within the context of food safety and the developmental potential of fluorescent probes in this field are summarized and discussed, aiming to provide a valuable reference for developing new probes for pesticide residue detection and future research directions.
39984826	Assessing insecticide susceptibility of Culex pipiens linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Aras River basin: implications for disease control.	Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, is the main vector of important medical and veterinary diseases including West Nile fever. This disease is a neglected mosquito-borne disease in Iran, where migratory and resident birds act as the main reservoirs and human and horse act as dead-end hosts of the disease. The Aras River basin is identified as a high-risk area for West Nile fever outbreaks. Chemical vector control stands out as a key method for managing mosquito-borne diseases. So, it is necessary to evaluate the susceptibility of Cx. pipiens to insecticides recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in this region in order to control possible outbreaks of the diseases.
39984777	Effects of neonicotinoid residues in Apis cerana indica bees and bee products: LC-MS/MS analysis and dietary risk assessment in a sunflower field study.	Bee colony decline, including in Apis cerana indica F., is a global concern linked to multiple factors, notably neonicotinoid insecticides. Residues in honey and pollen threaten bees and humans when exceeding safe levels, necessitating critical assessments of daily exposure thresholds. A controlled field experiment and dietary risk assessment studies were conducted to identify the impact of neonicotinoids. The LC-MS/MS method was developed to analyze residue in bee products. A survey of eight locations showed that only two honey samples, each from a different location, were contaminated with imidacloprid (0.03 µg g<sup>-1</sup>) and acetamiprid (0.07 µg g<sup>-1</sup>) residues. Similarly, a separate field experiment in sunflower detected neonicotinoid residues (0.025-0.456 μg g<sup>-1</sup>) in bee products. The field experiment indicated significantly higher bee mortality in the clothianidin sprayed field, using dead bee trap (88.00 bees) and cotton fabric spread (10.50 bees), than in the control field one day after spraying (DAS). Foraging activity significantly improved in the control plots, with increased incoming nectar (7.18 bees/min) and outgoing forager activity (13.28 bees/min) at 15 DAS. Colony growth parameters, namely, honey (61.88 cm<sup>2</sup>), pollen (41.25 cm<sup>2</sup>), brood area (91.00 cm<sup>2</sup>), and population (3479.50 bees) were highest in the control. The yield parameters followed the descending order of control > dimethoate > thiacloprid > imidacloprid > thiamethoxam > clothianidin. The dietary neonicotinoid residue risk evaluation showed moderate-high risk (risk quotient > 5) for bees but tolerable hazard (hazard quotient < 1) for humans. Hence, these neonicotinoid effects should be further explored through comprehensive risk analysis to safeguard native bee populations while maintaining effective crop protection practices.
39984525	Insecticidal activity of Delonix regia (Fabaceae) against the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Bois) with reference to its phytochemical composition.	Overuse of synthetic pesticides causes problems for humans and the environment or leads to insect resistance to insecticides, so plant extracts and essential oils have gained popularity as an environmentally acceptable alternative to chemical pesticides. This study investigated the toxicity of Delonix regia leaf and seed extracts, protein patterns, and genetic distance analysis against the 5th instar larvae of cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis Boisaduval. Methanol, petroleum ether, and acetone extracts of leaves and seeds of D. regia were used to coat castor leaves for ingestion by the 5th instar of S. littoralis larvae. The seeds' methanol and petroleum ether extracts were the most effective (100 and 98 Mortality%), with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.887 and 1.795 g/L, respectively, 24 h post-treatments. Data showed that D. regia extracts affected consequences of protein changes compared to untreated S. littoralis larvae resulted in genetic changes, as well as inhibition of the insect's important α-amylases, forming protein complexes, and influencing normal growth and development. GC-MS analysis of the chemical composition of the seed extract revealed 18 compounds with high levels of stigmasterol, 2-methyl-4-vinylphenol, benzoic acid, 3-hydroxy, and squalene with percentages of 43.07%, 21.33%, 14.51%, and 14.12%, respectively. As a result, we concluded that D. regia seed extracts had the potential to control Spodoptera littoralis larvae.
39984486	Fabrication of atomically dispersed barium hydride catalysts for the synthesis of deuterated alkylarenes.	Marvelous natures of alkali and alkaline earth metal hydrides in catalyzing chemical transformations are being discovered. However, the synthesis of (sub)nanostructured metal hydrides, critically important to enhance their catalytic performances, is yet a very challenging task. Herein, we develop a highly reactive heterogeneous catalyst comprising atomically dispersed barium hydrides on MgO support with an ultrahigh barium loading of up to 20 wt% via a convenient preparation method involving liquid-ammonia impregnation followed by hydrogenation. The surface barium hydride species not only exhibits extraordinary reactivity toward H<sub>2</sub> activation at room temperature, but also enables the highly efficient hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of both sp<sup>3</sup> C-H and sp<sup>2</sup> C-H bonds in nonactivated alkylarenes using D<sub>2</sub> as the deuterium source under mild conditions. The deuteration rate at benzylic site is two orders of magnitude higher than that of bulk BaH<sub>2</sub>. This study offers an alternative synthetic route for the manufacture of deuterium-labeled compounds using a heterogenous transition metal-free hydride catalyst beyond the widely studied molecular metal complexe catalysts.
39984208	Highly sensitive and aptamer-based electrochemical fipronil biosensor based on primer exchange reaction and catalytic strand displacement dual recycling amplifications.	The indiscriminate use of pesticides in agriculture has caused substantial harm to both the environment and human health. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods for evaluating trace amounts of pesticide residues in food products. This study presents a highly sensitive electrochemical aptasensor to detect fipronil utilizing a new primer exchange reaction (PER)/catalytic strand displacement reaction (CSDR)-integrated dual signal amplification strategy.
39984204	Ultrasensitive detection of Vibrio parahaemolyticus based on boric acid-functionalized Eu (III)-based metal-organic framework.	This study intends to create a ratiometric fluorescence probe utilizing aptamers for the detection of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) in aquatic products. In this design, aptamer-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles specifically capture V. parahaemolyticus, while boric acid on Eu (III)-Based Metal-Organic Framework (Eu-MOF) interacts with glycolipids present on bacterial cells, thereby achieving dual recognition of V. parahaemolyticus. This fluorescent probe quantitatively detects V. parahaemolyticus by measuring the intensity of ratio fluorescence. The sensor demonstrates a detection range from 77 to 7.7 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mL, possessing a detection threshold down to 1 CFU/mL. Moreover, the developed method based on Eu-MOF had been successfully applied to real samples. To achieve rapid on-site detection of V. parahaemolyticus, the study designed a portable smartphone sensor that confirms its capability for rapidly detecting pathogens and contributes significantly to establishing a system for regulating safety in detecting food and environment.
39983969	Alterations of early-life gut microbiome in hospitalized infants with chemical pollutants exposure.	Exposure to chemical pollutants and their effects on the gut microbiome during early life are scarce, especially the effects of mixed exposures. Plasma pollutants levels were measured using gas chromatography -triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC-MS/MS) among 304 infants in the neonatal ward at Hunan Children's hospital, China, and gut microbiota was derived from 16S rRNA sequencing. We assessed exposure and alpha diversity using generalized linear models, and variation in beta diversity (Bray-Curtis), taxa abundance (MaAsLin2), and employed Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to investigate the association of pollutants mixture with alpha diversity and taxa. PBDE-99 was positively associated with the Chao1 index (β = 4.29, 95%CI:1.54,7.03). Exposure to the pesticides trifluralin, γ-BHC, and methidathion significantly affected beta diversity (all P<sub>FDR</sub> < 0.05). PBDE-100, β-BHC, phosalone, methiamitron, fenpropathrin, δ-BHC, and o,p'-DDT were associated with changes in taxa abundance, including negative associations [e.g., Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Corynebacterium] and positive associations [e.g., Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas]. An interaction between o,p'-DDT and δ-BHC on Pseudomonas was also found in BKMR models. Our findings suggest that chemical pollutants are associated with gut microbiome changes in hospitalized infants, providing new insights into the mechanisms of chemical pollutants toxicity. Further validation is necessary to confirm these associations and explore their long-term health effects.
39983853	Chlordecone reduces hyperpolarization-activated-current (Ih) conductance in honeybee.	The pacemaker channel (HCN) is responsible for electrical activity in a wide range of excitable cells, including those of invertebrates. Using Xenopus oocytes and HEK cell, we show here that HCN-channel from Apis mellifera is activated by hyperpolarization, modulated by cAMP, and blocked by cesium. Its PNa/PK relative permeability is 1:3, and its unitary conductance is 1.5 pS, which is similar to that of the mammalian HCN2 channel. Moreover, bee h-current is blocked by high concentrations of ZD7288, and organochlorine pesticide chlordecone reduces Ih amplitude in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value was 9.37 µM) and diminishes HCN conductance, while preserving voltage dependence. In contrast, Deltamethrin exhibits no discernible impact. Molecular docking of Chlordecone in a homology model of bee HCN generated by AlphaFold3 suggests a binding site located at the end of the S6 helix that could explain the conductance inhibition caused by Chlordecone.
39983817	ML-AMPs designed through machine learning show antifungal activity against C. albicans and therapeutic potential on mice model with candidiasis.	C. albicans resistant strains have led to increasingly severe treatment challenges. Antimicrobial peptides with low resistance-inducing propensity for pathogens have been developed. A series of antimicrobial peptides de novo designed through machine learning by our research team were named ML-AMPs. In the present research, the antifungal activity of ML-AMPs against C. albicans and its therapeutic potential on Candidiasis mice model were studied.
39983534	Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) increase time to operating room without increasing postoperative hematologic complications in patients with fragility fractures of the proximal femur.	Fragility fractures of the proximal femur are common injuries with significant morbidity and mortality. The use of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications is increasing among the elderly and is associated with perioperative bleeding-related complications. The primary aim of this study was to examine how DOAC use affects surgical timing and postoperative hematologic complications in patients treated operatively for fragility fractures of the proximal femur. The effect of an institutional tranexamic acid (TXA) protocol implemented during the study period was investigated as a secondary aim.
39983502	Relation between shape-tailored CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles morphology and hemocompatibility and antimicrobial effect.	Cerium is one of the most studied rare elements whose oxidative state (Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup>) can be changed in different environments. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs), which are nevertheless more complex chemical structures, are nowadays very exciting entities involved in the biomedical field, particularly in the four stages of wound healing. In the first stage, called hemostasis, several issues such as the required morphology to be biologically efficient, and the effect of Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup> on the applicability potential of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs remain unclear. Our interest is focused in this study on the detailed understanding of the cations' location, when differently shaped CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs (i.e., nanocube, nanosphere, nanorod, and polyhedral particles) were used. Additionally, the present research highlights the applicability of nanoparticles in direct contact with blood and the antibacterial and antifungal properties of the samples. A correlation between the fungicidal properties of the samples and the Ce<sup>3+</sup> cations formed on the surface was performed. The nanosphere/nanorod particles show the highest interaction with the hemoglobin (Hb). In addition, it was concluded that negatively charged surfaces favor the antibacterial properties using gram-negative bacteria. The morphologies' applicability will depend on the following parameters: surface area/volume ratio, crystallinity, hydrophilicity, Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Ce<sup>4+</sup> ion distribution, and surface charge. Considering all these parameters and the nanoparticle applications, the nanorod will be the most suitable for antimicrobiological applications (antibacterial and antifungal), and showing the highest hemocompatibility.
39983473	Bimetallic lanthanide metal-organic framework supported ratiometric molecularly imprinted fluorescence sensor: An innovation for selective and visual detection of dimethyl phthalate.	Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) is a prototypical member of the phthalic acid ester class of plasticizers that may remain in food, posing a considerable risk to both food safety and human health. An innovative ratiometric fluorescence sensor (MIPs@BL-MOF) was constructed by incorporating bimetallic lanthanide terbium/europium metal-organic framework (BL-MOF) into molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for the rapid selective and visual detection of DMP. In this work, BL-MOF prepared by the 'post-mixing' strategy was intelligently incorporated in the MIPs layer, giving the sensor the ability of rapid mass transfer, efficient binding, excellent anti-interference, and high selectivity. Based on the photoelectron transfer mechanism, high-affinity detection of DMP was realized by MIPs@BL-MOF with a good linear fitting (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9944) and theoretical detection limit of 3.29 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> in the range of 1.0 × 10<sup>-8</sup>-1.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup>. More importantly, a portable visual sensing platform integrated by the MIPs@BL-MOF sensor and smartphone was successfully applied to DMP detection. Accordingly, the MIPs@BL-MOF-based ratiometric fluorescence sensing platform with desirable specificity, sensitivity, and portability holds great potential for the rapid and visual detection of plasticizers for ensuring environmental and food safety.
39983279	Fabrication of a flexible nanofiber membrane for SERS detection of pollutants: An efficient and eco-friendly approach.	The development of electrospun nanomaterials as highly efficient and portable substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is of great significance for rapid detection of pollutant molecules. In this work, we prepared sustainable polylactic acid (PLA) electrospun nanofibers decorated with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) as a flexible SERS substrate through a combined process of facile electrospinning and green plasma treatment. Using rhodamine 6G (R6G) as probe molecule, the PLA/Ag NPs composite nanofibers show excellent SERS performance and allow the detection of R6G at a low concentration of 10<sup>-10</sup> M. In addition, the SERS substrate could be used for trace detection of pesticide thiram, and exhibits high sensitivity with a detection limit of 10<sup>-8</sup> M. By taking advantage of the flexibility of the nanofibers, the nanofibrous membrane was pasted on the surface of an apple to sample and detect residual thiram, and the pesticide could be distinctly identified even at a low concentration of 10<sup>-7</sup> M. The presence of dense Ag NPs with numerous hot-spots played a crucial role in the substrate's high sensitivity for SERS detection. This environmentally friendly, self-supporting SERS substrate holds great promise for diverse applications, including environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics.
39982542	Enhancing tiny millets through genome editing: current status and future prospects.	This study aims to address the critical need for genetic improvement of small millets, which are vital yet underutilized cereal crops cultivated in semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. Given their high nutritional value and climate resilience, small millets hold significant potential for food security and sustainable agriculture in arid regions. However, traditional breeding methods have proven to be time-consuming and inefficient in enhancing desirable traits. This study highlights the transformative potential of genome editing technologies, particularly the CRISPR/Cas9 system, in accelerating the development of improved small millet varieties. The findings presented in this paper detail recent advancements in using CRISPR/Cas for enhancing resistance to biotic stresses, including bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. Additionally, we explore how genome editing can be applied to improve abiotic stress tolerance, addressing challenges such as drought, cold, heat, and herbicides in small millets. We discuss the existing challenges faced by breeders, including issues related to ploidy levels, off-target effects, and limitations in organelle genome modification. The review also suggests potential strategies for overcoming these bottlenecks, aiming to develop stress-resistant super cultivars. Overall, this paper provides an overview of the current state of genome editing research in small millets while identifying future opportunities to enhance key traits for nutrient enrichment and climate resilience, ultimately paving the way for advancements in these crucial crops.
39982272	Evaluating TcAs for Use in Biotechnology Applications.	ABC toxin complexes (Tcs) are tripartite complexes that come together to form nano-syringe-like translocation systems. ABC Tcs are often compared with <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (Bt) toxins, and as such, they have been highly studied as a potential novel pesticide to combat growing insect resistance. Moreover, it is possible to substitute the cytotoxic hypervariable region with alternative peptides, which promise potential use as a novel peptide delivery system. These toxins possess the unique ability to form active chimeric holotoxins across species and display the capability to translocate a variety of payloads across membrane bilayers. Additionally, mutagenesis on the linker region and the receptor binding domains (RBDs) show that mutations do not inherently cause a loss of functionality for translocation. For these reasons, Tcs have emerged as an ideal candidate for targeted protein engineering. However, elucidation of the specific function of each RBD in relation to target receptor recognition currently limits the use of a rational design approach with any ABC Tc. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of targeting and biodistribution data for many Tcs among mammals and mammalian cell lines. Here, we outline two separate strategies for modifying the targeting capabilities of the A subunit (TcA) from <i>Xenorhabdus nematophilus</i>, Xn-XptA2. We identify novel structural differences that make Xn-XptA2 different than other characterized TcAs and display the modular capabilities of substituting RBDs from alternative TcAs into the Xn-XptA2 scaffold. Finally, we show the first, to our knowledge, biodistribution data of any TcA in mice.
39982054	Fungicide use intensity influences the soil microbiome and links to fungal disease suppressiveness in amenity turfgrass.	Disease-suppressive soils have been documented in many economically important crops, but not in turfgrass, one of the most intensively managed plant systems in the United States. Dollar spot, caused by the fungus <i>Clarireedia jacksonii</i>, is the most economically important disease of managed turfgrass and has historically been controlled through the intensive use of fungicides. However, previous anecdotal observations of lower dollar spot severity on golf courses with less intensive fungicide histories suggest that intensive fungicide usage may suppress microbial antagonism of pathogen activity. This study explored the suppressive activity of transplanted microbiomes against dollar spot from seven locations in the Midwestern U.S. and seven locations in the Northeastern U.S. with varying fungicide use histories. Creeping bentgrass was established in pots containing homogenized sterile potting mix and field soil and inoculated with <i>C. jacksonii</i> upon maturity. Bacterial and fungal communities of root-associated soil and phyllosphere were profiled with short-amplicon sequencing to investigate the microbial community associated with disease suppression. The results showed that plants grown in the transplanted soil microbiome collected from sites with lower fungicide intensities exhibited reduced disease severity. Plant growth-promoting and pathogen-antagonistic microbes may be responsible for disease suppression, but further validation is required. Additional least squares regression analysis of the fungicides used at each location suggested that contact fungicides such as chlorothalonil and fluazinam had a greater influence on the microbiome disease suppressiveness than penetrant fungicides. Potential organisms antagonistic to <i>Clarireedia</i> were identified in the subsequent amplicon sequencing analysis, but further characterization and validation are required.
39981892	<i>meta</i>-Cycloparaphenylenes (<i>m</i>CPPs) with pendant carborane.	The design of easily modifiable nanohoops with favourable photophysical properties is crucial for their applications. Here, carborane-based boron-clusters are linked to <i>meta</i>-cycloparaphenylenes (<i>m</i>CPPs) as pendants through an alkyne insertion reaction with decaborane from an <i>m</i>CPP-alkyne precursor. Subsequent deboronation reaction efficiently yields ionic <i>m</i>CPP compounds with a high fluorescence quantum yield (81%) in solution.
39981875	Bioinspired Cerium Nanozyme Microenvironment Regulation for Efficient Dephosphorylation and Detection of Organophosphorus Pesticides.	Mimicking the structure of natural enzyme active sites offers a promising strategy for the rational design of nanozymes. However, this biomimetic approach predominantly focuses on replicating the configuration of the metal active center in natural enzymes, often overlooking the critical influence of the catalytic site's microenvironment. Here, inspired by the active center and coordination microenvironment of natural organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH), Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CN<sub>2</sub>/NC, a novel cerium-based nanozyme is first reported to mimic OPH. In Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CN<sub>2</sub>/NC, Ce species serve as active sites, while the adjacent N site ([N═C═N]<sup>2-</sup>) functions as a general base, mimicking histidine in natural enzymes to facilitate the hydrolysis process. Using paraoxon as a model target, Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CN<sub>2</sub>/NC demonstrates rapid dephosphorylation of phosphotriester across a wide range of temperatures and pH values, significantly outperforming natural OPH and CeO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. The systematic experiments and theoretical calculations reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for the enhanced OPH-mimicking performance. Capitalizing on its phosphatase-like activity, Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CN<sub>2</sub>/NC nanozyme is successfully employed to develop a colorimetric biosensor for the rapid and selective detection of organophosphorus pesticides. This study holds great promise in developing efficient nanozymes and broadens the range of Ce-based nanozymes.
39981862	Insecticide resistance management scenarios differ for RNA-based sprays and traits.	RNA-based bioinsecticides that comprise a dsRNA active ingredient and function by RNA interference (RNAi) are being commercialised as insecticidal traits in transgenic crops and as sprayable biopesticides. These RNAi insecticidal technologies are valuable alternatives to conventional chemical insecticides due to their efficacy, high degree of specificity and favourable human and environmental safety profiles. As with all pesticides, appropriate insect resistance management (IRM) programmes are required to mitigate the selection for resistance in target insect populations and extend product durability in the field. IRM programmes for RNAi products follow the same guidelines that currently exist for insecticidal traits or conventional insecticidal sprays. These guidelines reflect the distinct exposure scenarios for traits versus sprays, that is, continuous exposure when dsRNA is expressed in the crop compared to intermittent exposure when sprayed on foliage. As such, IRM plans for dsRNA traits depend on pyramiding (stacking) non-cross-resistant traits along with a refuge of non-transgenic plants. On the other hand, IRM plans for dsRNA sprays rely on the timing of the application so that only a single generation of the pest is exposed, followed by the use of an insecticide from a different IRAC mode of action group.
39981753	Self-Reported Pesticide Application, Access to Pesticide Labels, and QR Code Use Among Agricultural H-2A Workers, North Carolina, 2024.	Despite the composition of the United States' agricultural workforce and the sector's reliance on Spanish-speaking migrant labor, pesticide labels are largely available in English only. Currently, federal regulators are considering strategies to provide pesticide label information access in Spanish via a QR code or through other electronic methods on the pesticide container. Data on access to labels and the use of QR codes among agricultural workers are limited. We provide policy-relevant findings from surveys collected at a large agricultural worker H-2A visa arrival hub.
39981441	Fulminant Phlegmonitis of the Esophagus and Stomach.	Phlegmonous esophagogastritis is a rare and life-threatening condition characterized by purulent inflammation of the submucosal and muscularis layers of the esophagus and stomach. We report the case of a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension and prior herbicide ingestion who presented with fever, sore throat, chest pain, and progressive abdominal pain. Initial misdiagnosis of pancreatitis delayed treatment. Endoscopy revealed extensive mucosal detachment, submucosal edema, purulent exudates, and fistula formation, while computed tomography (CT) demonstrated gastric wall thickening and intramural gas. Microbiological analysis identified <i>Streptococcus</i> spp., Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus co-infections. Despite intensive therapy, including antibiotics, antivirals, nutritional support, and pleural drainage, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to multi-organ failure and death. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by nonspecific symptoms of phlegmonous esophagogastritis, the critical importance of early endoscopic evaluation, and the value of microbiological analysis for tailored treatment. Early recognition and timely intervention are essential to improving outcomes for this potentially fatal condition.
39981375	Distribution and frequency of genetic mutations in three insecticide targets in field populations of <i>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</i> in Mianyang City, Sichuan Province, China.	Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an important mosquito borne infectious disease which is mainly transmitted by <i>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</i> Giles (1901) in China. At present, vector control remains an important means to prevent and control vector-borne diseases including JE. The development of insecticide resistance has seriously threatened the effectiveness of insecticide-based vector control programmes. Therefore, understanding insecticide resistance in the target pest is essential to inform evidence-based vector control. In Mianyang City of Sichuan Province of China, <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i> is the dominant mosquito species, and JE has been documented in this city. Unfortunately, there is little information on the status and underlying mechanisms of insecticide resistance in field populations of <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i>, the main JE vector in this region. In the study, a total of 314 adults of <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i>, collected from 6 sites across Mianyang City, were inspected for resistance-conferring mutations in three genes encoding voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor Rdl subunit (Rdl), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by DNA Sanger sequencing. The results showed that the classical L1014F mutation in VGSC was distributed in all the 6 populations at varying frequencies from 16.98% to 27.78%, and the frequency of F455W mutation in AChE was extremely high (97.06%-100%). Notably, the conserved mutations A296S and V327I previously reported in the Rdl of some other species of mosquitoes were discovered in <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i> for the first time. The frequency of the resistant Rdl 296S allele was 62.04% to 94.00%, while the V327I mutation was present at a much lower frequency ranging from 0.93% to 1.8%. Overall, the prevalent co-existence of resistance-conferring mutations in multiple insecticide target proteins in <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i> populations in Mianyang City indicates a worrying status of insecticide resistance, and suggests that it is highly required to monitor the phenotypic resistance of <i>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</i> on a regular basis.
39981329	Recto Sigmoid Sub-Mucosal Bleeding Due to Warfarin over Anticoagulation Presenting as Intestinal Obstruction.	Patients on anticoagulation therapy, particularly those on warfarin, are at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, gum bleeding, hematuria, and ecchymosis. However, it is rare for such patients to present with intramural or submucosal bleeding leading to intestinal obstructive symptoms. Sub-mucosal intestinal bleeding due to prolonged anticoagulant use is uncommon. Literature suggests that the duodenum and small intestine are common locations for anticoagulant-induced hematomas, occurring in approximately 1 case per 2,500 anticoagulated patients per year. However, intramural colonic hematomas are rarely reported. Spontaneous anticoagulant induced hematomas may develop as early as 10 days after starting therapy. We report the case of a 63-year-old female who presented with recto-sigmoid sub-mucosal bleeding causing obstructive symptoms. The patient was managed surgically with laparotomy, resulting in significant improvement, and was scheduled for follow-up to evaluate the feasibility of reintroducing anticoagulation therapy.
39981186	Exploring the CD3/CD56/TNF-α/Caspase3 pathway in pyrethroid-induced immune dysregulation: curcumin-loaded chitosan nanoparticle intervention.	Conflict reports exist on the impact of pyrethroid insecticides on immune function and the probable underlying mechanisms.
39980755	Co-inoculation of <i>Trichoderma viride</i> with <i>Azospirillum brasilense</i> could suppress the development of <i>Harpophora maydis</i>-infected maize in Egypt.	Plant diseases caused by fungal pathogens are responsible for severe damage to strategic crops worldwide. Late wilt disease (LWD) is a vascular disease that occurs late in maize development. <i>Harpophora maydis</i>, the causative agent of maize LWD, is responsible for significant economic losses in Egypt. Therefore, the aim of this study was to control LWD of maize using an alternative approach to reduce the use of chemical pesticides. A combination of <i>Trichoderma viride</i>, a fungal biocontrol agent, and <i>Azospirillum brasilense</i>, a bacterial endophytic plant growth promoter, was applied <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in planta</i>. <i>T. viride</i> showed high mycoparasitic potential against <i>H. maydis via</i> various antagonistic activities, including the production of lytic enzymes, secondary metabolites, volatile compounds, and siderophores. <i>A. brasilense</i> and <i>T. viride</i> filtrates were also shown to suppress <i>H. maydis</i> growth, in addition to their ability to produce gibberellic and indole acetic acids. A significant change in the metabolites secreted by <i>T. viride</i> was observed using GC/MS in the presence of <i>H. maydis</i>. A field experiment was conducted on susceptible and resistant hybrids of maize to evaluate the antagonistic activity of <i>T. viride</i> combined with <i>A</i>. <i>brasilense</i> on LWD incidence as well as plant growth promotion under field conditions. The data revealed a significant decrease in both disease incidence and severity in maize plants treated with <i>T. viride</i> and/or <i>A. brasilense</i>. Further, there was a noticeable increase in all plant growth and yield parameters. An anatomical examination of the control and inoculated maize roots was also reflective of plant responses under biotic stress. Taken together, the obtained results provide successful eco-friendly management strategies against LWD in maize.
39980686	Biological characterization of novel <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 phages and their bacteriostatic effects in milk and pork.	Foodborne bacteria, particularly <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) O157:H7, are significant contributors to foodborne illnesses, with antibiotic overuse exacerbating the issue through the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. This study investigated the potential of <i>E. coli</i> phages in food safety, examining their biological traits and bacteriostatic properties. Two phages (vB_EcoP_SD2, vB_EcoP_SD6) of <i>E. coli</i> O157:H7 were isolated from slaughterhouse sewage and characterized for morphology, genomic composition, phage phylogenetic tree, optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI), one-step growth curve, thermal and pH stability and antibacterial efficacy. The optimal MOIs of vB_EcoP_SD2 and vB_EcoP_SD6 was 0.1 and 0.01, and temperature range for maintaining activity was 4°C to 55°C. The host range of vB_EcoP_SD2 and vB_EcoP_SD6 was 65% (13/20) and 55% (11/20), which was partially complementary to each other (75%, 15/20). Notably, vB_EcoP_SD2 displayed a latent period of 10 min, a burst period of 80 min, and a burst volume of 80 PFU per cell, while vB_EcoP_SD6 had a burst volume of 10 PFU per cell. Comprehensive whole-genome analysis confirmed two phages has no presence of pathogenic factors or resistance genes. Genomic comparisons suggest vB_EcoP_SD2 and vB_EcoP_SD6, respectively, constituted a novel member of a new genus, Justusliebigvirus genus and Kayfunavirus genus which genome, respectively, was found to be 1,49,066 bp, 40,202 bp long with an average GC content of 37.5 and 49.8%. The phages effectively inhibited host bacteria in LB broth for at least 6 h and showed promise in inhibiting bacteria in milk and pork, which indicated that the two phages exhibited a favorable bacteriostatic effect on milk and pork within the first 6 h under the optimal MOI. In the milk bacteriostasis experiment, vB_EcoP_SD2 could reduce bacteria by 3.16 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL, and vB_EcoP_SD6 could reduce bacteria by 1.05 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL. Phage vB_EcoP_SD2 decreased bacteria by 1.14 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL, and vB_EcoP_SD6 decreased bacteria by 2.04 × 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL in the pork. There was no disparity in bacteriostatic effect of different MOI within the first 6 h, but bacteriostatic effect of all groups still remained different from that of the control group. This study indicates the two phages possess excellent biological characteristics, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for the subsequent development of natural fungicides.
39980431	RNAi technology development for weed control: all smoke and no fire?	RNA interference (RNAi) technology, specifically Spray-Induced Gene Silencing (SIGS), holds potential as an innovative approach for selective weed control, promising environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional herbicides. Although the development of RNAi-based crop protection agents against pathogens, insects and viruses is advancing rapidly, RNAi-based weed control remains in the nascent stages, with challenges in gene target specificity and effective delivery mechanisms. It is potentially a game-changer in agriculture, yet SIGS's applicability is limited by the lack of scientific evidence. The overall aim of this review is to focus attention on critical points that need to be addressed to advance the knowledge about and development of RNAi herbicides, and overcome the poor progress achieved so far. Enhancing RNAi delivery methods and focusing on high impact weed species could transform SIGS into a viable tool for sustainable agriculture. © 2025 The Author(s).

39980407	Methuselah-like 2 mediated 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) signaling regulates molting and fecundity in Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are very promising as the targets of endogenous neuropeptides/neuromodulators that, upon binding to receptors, induce profound changes in insect physiology. The Methuselan/Methuselan-like subfamily of GPCRs is reported to be associated with longevity and stress resistance. A previous study showed the fungicide jingangmycin-induced expression of Mthl2 and enhanced stress resistance in Nilaparvata lugens. However, the other physiological functions of Mthl2 remain unelucidated.
39980048	Sustainable management of tick infestations in cattle: a tropical perspective.	The increasing challenge of tick infestations in cattle production systems calls for innovative and sustainable solutions. This article explores the diverse ethnoveterinary practices and livestock farming systems prevalent in tropical regions, capitalizing on the characteristic biodiversity, to provide valuable insights and lessons for tick management at a global scale. Additionally, leveraging the genetic diversity of indigenous cattle breeds presents a promising approach for reducing reliance on chemical acaricides and fostering eco-friendly practices. While genomic selection is the cornerstone for addressing the polygenic nature of tick resistance, complementary genomic tools such as marker-assisted selection (MAS) can still play a valuable role. Integrating MAS and genomic tools could facilitate the development of tick-resistant cattle breeds, benefiting both tropical and temperate regions. Addressing challenges such as limited genomic resources, region-specific phenotyping methods, and the need for robust data infrastructure is essential for achieving tick management through genetic selection. Thus, tropical countries can contribute not only to their own livestock agriculture but also to global efforts in sustainable tick management. While some integrated approaches exist, further research is needed to objectively evaluate and optimize the combination of these different management strategies to effectively address tick challenges.
39979954	Use of a portable field-adapted liquid chromatographic system (C-Vue machine) to estimate the quantity of deltamethrin on insecticide-treated nets paired with WHO cone bioassays to determine ITN bioefficacy as part of three-year durability monitoring in Mali.	Monitoring insecticide levels and physical integrity over time is essential for assessing the durability of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), which largely depends on the net handling habits of users. This study determined the insecticide content and effectiveness of ITNs (Yorkool and PermaNet 2.0) at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after a mass distribution campaign in Mali.
39979693	Diversity and Implication of Symbiotic Bacteria in Aphids-Ants Relationships in Madagascar.	Facultative bacteria in aphids provide their hosts with various physiological and ecological adaptations, such as resistance to thermal stress, parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi. Furthermore, these symbionts possess the capacity to modulate the composition of honeydew, a substance that is particularly favored by numerous ant species. That's why we were interested in determining whether the presence of facultative bacteria in myrmecophilic aphids influences their relationship with mutualistic ants. In the vicinity of Antananarivo (Madagascar), the objectives of the study were to (i) determine the diversity of ants, aphids and symbionts and to (ii) assess the impacts of the identified symbiont on behavioural interactions of ants and aphids. We identified a total of four species (Serratia symbiotica, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Hamiltonella defensa) of facultative symbionts present in the three ant species (Camponotus maculate, Monomorium madecassum, Nylanderia gracilis) we tested and a total of six facultative symbionts (Serratia symbiotica, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Hamiltonella defensa, Regiella insecticola, Rickettsiella) among three of the five aphid species (Aphis citricidus, Aphis fabae, Aphis spiraecola, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, Rhopalosiphum maidis) we tested. Although our results did not show the involvement of symbionts on ant behaviour or their association with aphids, our study showed that the number of ants increases with the number of interactions, that Nylanderia gracilis are the ants with the most interactions and finally that ants observed on pesticide-treated plots have fewer interactions with aphids.
39979681	Acaricidal activity of Brassicaceae seed meals on Ixodid ticks: a potential plant-based control agent.	Ticks are a medically important group of arthropods, and their control has become a major challenge due to their widespread resistance to synthetic acaricides. Defatted seed meals of plants in the mustard family, commonly generated as byproducts of vegetable oil and biofuel production are known to possess pesticidal properties but their potential to control ticks remain poorly understood. We evaluated the bio-fumigation activity of defatted seed meals of three mustard family species, Brassica juncea (L) Czern. (PG), Lepidium sativum L. (Ls) and Thlaspi arvense L. (DFP), against three medically important hard tick species: Ambylomma americanum (L.) [Aa], Dermacentor variabilis (Say) [Dv] and Ixodes scapularis (Say) [Is]. Volatiles produced by defatted seed meals of the three plant species had strong bio-fumigation activity against ticks, but their effects varied among the three tick species. Toxicity of DFP seed meals was significantly different among the three tick species (no overlap of the 95% CI) with LD<sub>50</sub> values of 0.056 g for Aa nymphs, 0.031 g for Dv nymphs, and 0.037 g for Is nymphs. Defatted Ls seed meals were more toxic to Dv (LD<sub>50</sub> = 0.022 g) and Is (LD<sub>50</sub> = 0.018 g) nymphs compared to Aa nymphs (LD<sub>50</sub> = 0.035 g) while defatted PG seed meals were more toxic to Is nymphs (LD<sub>50</sub> = 0.009 g) compared to Aa (LD<sub>50</sub> = 0.048 g) and Dv (LD<sub>50</sub> = 0.032 g) nymphs. This study is the first report to document that defatted Brassicaceae seed meals are a promising plant-based biofumigant for tick control that can be developed as a cheap, practical, and ecofriendly acaricide.
39979504	Selecting a pesticide leaching indicator for integration into a decision support system at farm scale.	The recent EU agricultural policy emphasises enhancing the sustainability of farming by promoting organic practices and the responsible management of chemical inputs such as pesticides. In this context, it is essential to provide farmers with reliable pesticide risk indicators that can be integrated into decision support systems, enabling them to identify optimal pest management strategies, minimise environmental impact, and monitor progress in improving farm-level sustainability. This paper outlines our approach to selecting the most appropriate pesticide risk indicator for assessing the potential leachability of pesticides into groundwater. For 46 active substances, we initially retrieved relevant data from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Conclusions documents, including Predicted Environmental Concentrations in groundwater (PEC<sub>gw</sub>). These values, considered of high quality, serve as reference points in the EU environmental risk assessment procedures for pesticide authorisation. We then compared these PEC<sub>gw</sub> values with results obtained from two indicators and a metamodel selected from the literature: the Groundwater Ubiquity Score (GUS) index, the Attenuation Factor (AF) index, and the metamodel used by the European Medicines Agency for the authorisation of veterinary pharmaceuticals. The analysis revealed that while all three methods generally aligned well with the PEC<sub>gw</sub> values reported in the EFSA documents, the AF index demonstrated the highest predictive capability. Furthermore, the AF index was more consistent with criteria such as ease of application and applicability across various geographical contexts. Therefore, the AF index was identified as the optimal choice for integration into decision support systems.
39979395	Label free quantitative proteomic analysis reveals the physiological and biochemical responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to cinnamon essential oil.	The increasing use of synthetic chemical herbicides has resulted in environmental, human and animal health issues. This has also led to the development of herbicide resistance in weed populations. The use of essential oils (EOs) can contribute to the development of effective, eco-friendly and nature-based alternatives to these chemical products due to their phytotoxicity and multisite action. Our study aimed to evaluate the proteomic response of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) leaves to the application of a cinnamon essential oil (CEO) emulsion. The results showed that the application of CEO emulsion at a concentration of 6% severely impacted the proteomic profile of A. thaliana, especially for membrane proteins and those involved in the photosynthesis process. Interestingly, 40 proteins were identified and listed as the most differentially accumulated proteins in the leaves of A. thaliana. CEO decreased the expression of all the proteins associated with catabolism and anabolism processes while simultaneously increasing the expression levels of proteins involved in the response to oxidative stress. Overall, these findings allowed us to obtain a global view of the proteome response to CEO, opening promising perspectives for the development of natural herbicides, especially given the low probability of developing resistant weed populations.
39979376	Understanding key population drivers of the spotted wing Drosophila in cultivated and natural areas in the Andes.	The spotted-wing drosophila (SWD), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumara) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), is a serious global pest. Understanding the drivers for its success is fundamental to develop sustainable management tools. Here we aim to gain further understanding of environmental influences, seasonal patterns, and landscape complexity that could promote population growth and dynamics of SWD in the Andean region. To achieve this, traps baited with apple cider vinegar were placed in the Andean region of Patagonia, where soft-skinned fruit farming is a key activity and SWD is well established. Traps were deployed in four transects, covering cultivated areas and non-crop habitats. Trap inspections were conducted twice per month during two years, with all SWD counted and sexed. Bycatch was also recorded. We observed SWD high abundances in summer and autumn across most environments, and sustained populations in the peripheral forest and wild blackberries year-round. Farms near forests experienced higher SWD populations in summer compared to those farther away. Successful management of this global pest should consider neighboring areas to farms as part of the deployed tactics. Incorporating this knowledge to future management strategies and predictive models for SWD could help reduce this pest´s damage, while minimizing the use of pesticides.
39979304	Evaluation of basil essential oils for antifungal and anti-aflatoxigenic activity against Aspergillus flavus.	Essential oils of basil herbs such as nyazbo or sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum), holy basil or tulsi (O. tenuiflorum), and African or clove basil (O. gratissimum) have traditionally been used for their therapeutic potential. These medicinal herbs are being cultivated and consumed globally, and the increasing demand for antimicrobial and antifungal natural products has led to the assessment of the potential of essential oils of medicinal plants to inhibit mycelial growth rather than synthetic fungicides. Thus, the present study explored natural alternatives to inhibit mycelial growth (Aspergilus flavus) and aflatoxin production. Linalool (25.40%), methyl chavicol (37.63%), and eugenol (39.52%) were identified as chief compounds in the EOs of O. basilicum, O. tenuiflorum, and O. gratissimum respectively. Ocimum tenuiflorum EO demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity at 0.75 µL mL<sup>- 1</sup> against Aspergillus flavus and totally inhibited the synthesis of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>). The AFB<sub>2</sub> production was completely inhibited at 0.25 µL mL<sup>- 1</sup> by O. tenuiflorum EO, while O. basilicum and O. gratissimum EOs showed inhibition against AFB<sub>2</sub> at 0.50 µL mL<sup>- 1</sup>, and 1.0 µL mL<sup>- 1</sup>, respectively. The present study suggests that EOs of basil herbs could be a potential natural alternative of synthetic fungicides to inhibit the fungal growth and aflatoxin production.
39978914	Chitosan-based Pickering double emulsion microcapsules improve the UV stability and the persistence of Bacillus thuringiensis on mosquito control.	Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is affected by ultraviolet radiation and bacterial sedimentation in pest control applications, leading to low pesticide utilization and a short duration of control. To improve Bt stability in these applications and prolong the duration of biological control, Bt LLP29 was first encapsulated using double emulsion technology, resulting in the formation of W<sub>1</sub>/O/W<sub>2</sub> double emulsion microcapsules with sodium lignosulfonate and chitosan as wall materials. The morphological structure and functionality of microcapsules were then systematically investigated. Notably, the survival rates of Bt bacteria and spores in the microcapsules were maintained at 22.98 % and 8.18 % after 96 h of UV irradiation, and the retention rate of insecticidal protein was increased by 41.42 % after 72 h, with high mosquito-killing activity maintained. Furthermore, the Bt microcapsules exhibited excellent suspension properties and sustained release capabilities, which enhanced the retention of Bt active ingredients in the environment of young mosquitoes and extended the duration of pest control. These studies pioneered the application of double emulsion technology and microcapsules to the encapsulation of Bt based on the functional properties of chitosan. This will pave the way for the development of multifunctional Bt preparations in agricultural applications and pest control.
39978910	siRNA self-assembled carboxymethyl chitosan and pymetrozine nucleic pesticides for enhanced control of Sogatella furcifera: Bidirectional transduction and detoxification inhibition.	Sogatella furcifera (Horváth) is a significant migratory pest in southeast Asia and northern Australia, exhibiting a notable resistance to the conventional insecticides, and RNAi pesticide is a promising approach for managing resistance. However, the poor stability and difficulty in delivery hinders its wide application. Here, we present a self-assembled siRNAs, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) and pymetrozine complex (abbreviated as PM-CMCS/siRNAs micro-complex) to facilitate the control of S. furcifera in rice. When the transcription factors USP and KrH1 were interfered with dsUSP or dsKr-H1, a mortality of 84.4 % ~ 88.9 % was observed at a concentration of 150 μg/mL of pymetrozine, indicating a potential strategy for managing pymetrozine resistance. With the envelope of CMCS, the micro-complex effectively enhances the siRNA stability >96 h, downregulates the expression of USP, KrH1, and CYP6FJ3, leading to a mortality of 100 % at 100 μg/mL pymetrozine. Moreover, the time-dependent disintegration of micro-complex induces the release of lesser PM-CMCS/siRNAs, allowing that more fluorescently labeled complexes were enriched in the phloem of rice via the apoplastic pathway. The integration of PM-CMCS/siRNAs enable precise enrichment in phloem and effective management of pest resistance by silencing their detoxification genes, and promises an environmental-friendly strategy for controlling devastating pest.
39978890	Mechanochemical conversion of chitin to high-bioactivity oligomers of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.	Organonitrogen chemicals are crucial in pharmaceutical production and material synthesis. However, the current overreliance on the energy-intensive and highly polluting Haber-Bosch synthesis process necessitates an urgent need to explore more sustainable and environmentally friendly methods for producing these chemicals. Herein, we report an effective method for the selective conversion of chitin into its oligomers in deionized water. A systematic investigation was conducted on the pretreatment of chitin using various physical methods, such as microwave, ultrasonic, and ball milling while keeping the power consumption constant. A series of techniques were used to investigate the molecular structure, surface morphology, and depolymerization degree of the pretreated chitin. Results demonstrate that ball milling is the most effective pretreatment method which achieves a significant reduction in the crystallinity and viscosity average molar mass of chitin. These changes are advantageous for the subsequent chitin selective depolymerization reactions. Ball milling chitin with solid acid Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@C-SO<sub>3</sub>H could improve the physical contact between chitin and the catalyst, leading to a substantial advancement in the subsequent selective depolymerization of chitin to its oligomers. 37.9 % yield of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and chitin oligosaccharides with polymerization of 2-4 could be obtained from ball-milled chitin when they were depolymerized in deionized water at a low temperature of 140 °C, and the yield of desired products is 23 times greater than that obtained from untreated chitin. The products obtained exhibited notable antioxidant and antifungal activities and could be directly used as biological pesticides. This strategy enables the efficient production of high-value organonitrogen chemicals from inexpensive bioresources in an environmentally friendly way.
39978807	Exploring Insecticidal Molecules with Random Forest: Toward High Insecticidal Activity and Low Bee Toxicity.	Insecticidal molecules with high activity are crucial for global pesticide reduction and food security. However, their usage is limited by their concomitant high toxicity to bees. Balancing insecticidal activity and bee toxicity remains a critical challenge in the exploitation of new insecticidal molecules. In this study, we propose a novel strategy for exploiting molecules that are both highly effective against pests and minimally harmful to bees. A series of molecules were synthesized and tested to train a machine learning (ML) model for predicting insecticidal activity against pests. Meanwhile, another ML model was trained by using publicly available data to predict bee toxicity. The models demonstrated good performance, with mean AUC values of 0.88 ± 0.05 for insecticidal activity and 0.91 ± 0.01 for bee toxicity. By integrating these two models, we successfully predicted and experimentally validated a molecule that exhibited a high insecticidal activity and low bee toxicity. This dual-ML-model approach offers a promising pathway for the development of insecticidal molecules that are both effective and environmentally safe, thereby contributing to sustainable agricultures.
39978754	Identification and detection of known and new viruses in larvae of laboratory-reared fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda.	The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, is a significant pest that causes economic losses worldwide. Many companies and research centers rear FAW to produce their microbiological-based products, such as viruses that target FAW. Nevertheless, colonies are vulnerable to collapsing, mainly due to uncontrolled and unexpected viral infections. In this work, dead FAWs exhibiting signs of viral infection were collected from unsuccessful attempts to propagate a baculovirus at a baculovirus production facility in Brazil. Total RNA was extracted and used to construct a cDNA library that was sequenced. The results showed the presence of five viruses, including three RNA viruses (alphanodavirus, rhabdovirus, and iflavirus) and two DNA viruses (densovirus and alphabaculovirus). To confirm the presence of the identified viruses in laboratory-reared FAWs, ten individual larvae from four accredited laboratories in Brazil were analyzed by RT-PCR with specific primers for each virus identified by sequencing, except the alphabaculovirus. Alphanodavirus and rhabdovirus were not detected in any of the four tested colonies, whereas the iflavirus was detected in two laboratories. A putative new densovirus was found in all samples. Accurate identification and timely detection of viruses that could disrupt the health of laboratory-reared insect colonies are crucial to ensure the production of high-quality biological products.
39978743	Environmental exposure to pesticides is associated with oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage, and elevated interleukin-8 in a child population.	Pesticide exposure can cause various adverse effects in humans, with children being particularly susceptible. Such exposure leads to neurological, immunological, respiratory, and genetic damage, primarily by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). The increase in ROS induces lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which generate DNA adducts. This study involved children aged 6-12 from three communities: two in an agricultural region (communities A and B) and one reference population (community C). The objective was to evaluate lipid peroxidation through malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, the content of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) adducts, and the concentrations of the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α in children environmentally exposed to pesticides. Anthropometric measurements were taken from the study population. Dialkylphosphates (DAP) in urine were determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Plasma concentrations of MDA and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) were quantified using biochemical assays and urinary concentrations of 8-OHdG. The findings showed that DAP, MDA, and 8-OHdG concentrations in communities A and B increased significantly compared with community C. Additionally, IL-8 exhibited a significant increase in community A compared to community C, while no significant differences were observed for IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Higher pesticide exposure is linked to oxidative stress, DNA damage and inflammation, key indicators of chronic diseases. In conclusion, this study provides evidence linking environmental pesticide exposure in agricultural communities to increased oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in children.
39978620	Housing characteristics, dietary patterns, and sociodemographic characteristics as predictors of persistent organic pollutant exposure among African American pregnant women in Atlanta.	Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Existing disparities in exposure across populations highlight the need for identifying modifiable risk factors. Here, we investigated the determinants of serum levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in pregnant African American women (N = 54).
39978517	Sodium-lignosulfonate-conjugated metal-organic frameworks as dual-stimulus-responsive carriers for improved pesticide targeting.	The use of intelligent pesticides that respond to environmental stimuli is a promising strategy for achieving sustainable pest control while mitigating pesticide-related environmental pollution. This study reports the design of a pH and laccase dual-stimulus-responsive pesticide-slow-release composite (IMI@UiO-66@SL). The composite utilises an imidacloprid (IMI)-encapsulated metal-organic framework (MOF; UiO-66) as a nano-carrier and sodium lignosulfonate (SL) as a capping agent. Results show that IMI@UiO-66@SL exhibits excellent IMI release properties in acidic and laccase-rich environments, which closely mimic the physiological and behavioural conditions of termites. Furthermore, compared to the original IMI formulation, IMI@UiO-66@SL exhibits enhanced and prolonged insecticidal activity. Briefly, this study reports a promising approach for the sustainable management of termite colonies.
39978232	Serum concentrations of persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals in U.S. military personnel: A comparison by race/ethnicity and sex.	We evaluated patterns of serum concentrations of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), in a U.S. military sample by race/ethnicity (R/E) and sex.
39978196	The combination of microplastics and glyphosate affects the microbiome of soil inhabitant Enchytraeus crypticus.	Microplastics and pesticides are emerging contaminants that threaten soil ecosystems, yet their combined effects on soil health and soil fauna remain poorly understood. In this study, we constructed a microcosm to assess the individual and combined effects of microplastics and glyphosate on soil physicochemical properties, microbial communities, and the gut microbiome of soil invertebrates (Enchytraeus crypticus). Biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) and conventional polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were introduced at environmentally relevant concentrations. Our results revealed that PLA had a stronger disruptive effect on soil microbial communities than PET, altering microbial diversity and functional composition. Glyphosate, in contrast, primarily influenced the gut microbiome of E. crypticus, reducing microbial diversity and inducing oxidative stress. Combined exposure to microplastics and glyphosate significantly intensified oxidative stress but did not amplify microbial dysbiosis beyond the effects of microplastics alone. Compare to PET, PLA combined with glyphosate had the most pronounced effects on both soil and gut microbiomes, suggesting that biodegradable microplastics may pose greater ecological risks than conventional microplastics when used alongside pesticides. These findings underscore the need for a reassessment of biodegradable plastic use in agriculture and highlight the complex interactions between microplastics and pesticides in shaping soil ecosystem health.
39978182	Laccase immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles for the degradation of imidacloprid: Based on multi-spectroscopy and molecular docking.	As a typical class of environmental endocrine disruptors, imidacloprid (IMI) poses a potential threat to the sustainable survival and reproduction of living beings and human beings. Consequently, it is crucial to establish an efficient degradation method to remove imidacloprid from the environment. The present study aimed to investigate the immobilized laccase for the detoxification of imidacloprid via multi-spectroscopy and molecular docking. Herein, laccase was immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles (NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs) using a novel immobilization technique based on glutaraldehyde cross-linking polymerization. A single factor experiment approach was used to optimize the immobilization conditions, which included temperature, pH, enzyme concentration, and reaction time. Notably, the optimal condition was determined as 50℃, pH 4, laccase concentration of 1.0 mg/mL and 1.5 h. Based on the immobilization conditions, the degradation efficiency of immobilized laccase was 41.92 % after 24 h. Following eight degradations, the immobilized laccase's relative activity stayed at 34.09 % of its initial activity, demonstrating exceptional operational stability and reusability. Moreover, the binding free energy between imidacloprid and laccase was calculated on the basis of molecular docking, as -7.2 kcal/mol. This study provides experimental techniques and theoretical references for the biological digestion of hazardous pesticide residues in the environment. In addition, this study improved the shortcomings of free laccase, provided an environmentally friendly and efficient method for the degradation of imidacloprid.
39978150	Exploring the larvicidal and pupicidal activities of new functionalized pyridines against Culex pipiens L. referring to molecular docking and SAR studies.	Pesticides are intensively employed to manage pests, but they pose a great challenge, developing pesticide resistance. So, searching for novel chemical structures is crucial to overcoming insecticide resistance. Herein, a new functionalized pyridine derivative 4 was effectively constructed in a one-step reaction through reacting four components, including piperonal, ethyl cyanoacetate, 2-acetylthiophene, and ammonium acetate, under ultrasonic conditions. Treatment of the derivative 5 with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol afforded the acetohydrazide derivative 8 that was utilized as a key precursor for the synthesis of Schiff<sup>'</sup>s bases and other nicotinonitriles. Moreover, new acetohydrazone derivatives (19-21) were furnished by the reaction of 8 with isatin, n-vinylpyrrolididone, and galactose, respectively. The data obtained from the spectral measurements was the basis for elucidating the structures of the new derivatives. The larvicidal and pupicidal potencies of the synthesized thienyl pyridine derivatives were assessed against Culex pipiens L., and most exhibited moderate to good activity. The larvae were more susceptible to 17, 19, 6 and 13 with LC<sub>50</sub> of 1.57, 1.91, 2.36 and 2.90 ppm, respectively, while pupae were less susceptible with LC<sub>50</sub> of 4.17, 5.03, 6.16 and 7.45 ppm, respectively. The various functional groups connected to the pyridine ring led to variations in the toxicity of synthesized compounds, which were clarified through the SAR study. At the same time, a molecular docking study was performed to demonstrate the compound's mode of action and the effect of inserted moieties on binding with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Collectively, the results imply that the thienyl pyridine derivatives could be used as mosquitocidal agents against C. pipiens larvae and pupae.
39978143	Thermal physiology of dung beetles exposed to ivermectin, a veterinary drug.	Global changes, including increasing temperatures and pesticide contamination threaten insect survival and reproduction by altering metabolism and stress responses. Of particular importance are insects that provide ecosystem services and are threatened by multiple stressors, such as dung beetles, which bury dung in forests and cattle pastures. This study investigated how elevated temperature and ivermectin, a common antiparasitic medication used in cattle that is excreted in dung, affect the thermal physiology of Euoniticellus intermedius dung beetles under controlled laboratory conditions. Our study evaluated, under laboratory conditions, the effect of the combination of high temperature and ivermectin, on heat tolerance, metabolic rate, and survival of female dung beetles E. intermedius. We found that ivermectin reduced survival at 29 °C but not at 33 °C, potentially due to heat-induced hormetic effects, which activate defense systems, protecting organisms from the effects of a second stressor, in this case, ivermectin. Ivermectin and high temperature increased metabolic rate, which could have potential negative effects on oxidative stress and longevity. Finally, critical thermal maximum was not affected by ivermectin or temperature. By impacting physiological traits and individual survival, high temperatures and pesticides may disrupt population dynamics and ecosystem services provided by dung beetles.
39978133	Photodegradation of Diquat in water under UV irradiation: Identification of transformation products and elucidation of photodegradation pathway.	In aquatic settings, photodegradation is a significant non-biodegradation method of pesticide degradation. In this investigation, the photodegradation of the herbicide Diquat in aqueous solution was examined under distinct conditions and concentrations. The initial concentration of Diquat and the pH value of the water environment significantly affected the half-life of photodegradation of Diquat, and the opposite was true for different types of water. The photodegradation transformation products (PTPs) formed by the photodegradation of Diquat in an aqueous solution under UV-Vis irradiation were separated and identified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-fight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). Based on mass spectral information, four main transition products were identified. Calculations of constituent composition, a comparison of structural analogs, and extant literature all contributed to the structure's determination. The main pathways of photodegradation were found to be oxidation, pyridine ring-opening, cleavage of [C-C] on the piperazine ring, Demethylation reaction and Hydroxylation. These results serve as a foundation for further environmental risk assessment and help explain how Diquat behaves in aquatic environments.
39978108	Natural pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazolinone derivatives: Design, synthesis, characterization, and bio-evaluation as novel antiviral agents.	As viral infectious diseases increasingly threaten global health, antiviral drug research has become a focus in the medicinal chemistry. Enterovirus has always been an important virus causing infections disease with a high incidence in summer and autumn, such as Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB<sub>3</sub>). Currently, no specific antiviral drugs are available for EV71 and CVB<sub>3</sub>. So, we designed and synthesized a novel series of quinazolinone derivatives based on the natural pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazolinone scaffold, which were fully characterized and identified as potential anti-enterovirus agents. Among them, compound B9 exhibited potent anti-CVB<sub>3</sub> activity with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 17.4 ± 3.62 μM, and compound B5 exhibited potent anti-EV71 activity with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 14.8 ± 2.18 μM as confirmed by determining the cytopathic effects, progeny virus titers, viral nucleic acid and protein levels. The potential antiviral mechanisms of compound B5 were also explored. The compound B5 exhibited a powerful therapeutic effect primarily by blocking the post-attachment stage of viral infection. Further experiments demonstrated that compound B5 didn't inhibit the activities of the EV71 2Apro and 3Dpol. Modelling of the molecular binding of the 3Cpro-compound complex revealed that the compound B5 could insert into the substrate-binding pocket of EV71 3Cpro, blocking substrate recognition and possibly inhibiting EV71 3Cpro activity. These researches may provide evidence for the development of these novel pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinazolinone derivatives derived from natural products as potential antiviral agents.
39978106	Effects of tefluthrin exposure on early life stages in zebrafish: Insights into cardiac and skeletal development, oxidative stress and apoptosis.	Tefluthrin, a pyrethroid insecticide commonly used in soil, has raised concerns due to its widespread use and residual presence in aquatic environments. Nevertheless, studies on the toxicological mechanisms of tefluthrin at relevant concentrations during the early life stages of aquatic species remain limited. In this study, we assessed the developmental effects of tefluthrin exposure at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 μg/L over 8 days on zebrafish embryos/larvae. Exposure to 100 μg/L of tefluthrin significantly reduced hatchability and survival rates, leading to cardiac edema and skeletal deformities. Alizarin Red and Alcian Blue staining showed reduced skeletal mineralization and disrupted craniofacial morphology. Importantly, tefluthrin exposure resulted in the dysregulation of important genes involved in heart and skeletal development, including nppa, vmhc, sox9b, gata4, runx2a, shha, sp7, and bmp2b. Mechanistically, tefluthrin exposure increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT), and elevated malondialdehyde (MDA). Furthermore, exposure to tefluthrin caused significant cell apoptosis in larvae, accompanied by dysregulation in the transcriptional expression of apoptotic genes (bcl2, bax, p53, and caspase-3). Treatment with the antioxidant astaxanthin alleviated tefluthrin-induced oxidative stress and provided protection against heart and skeletal toxicity. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that tefluthrin's developmental toxicity affected heart and skeletal development, with mechanisms involving changes in gene expression, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, providing valuable insights for assessing environmental and food contamination risks.
39978101	Exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of chlorpyrifos induces transcriptional changes and neurotoxicity in Poecilia gillii without clear behavioral effects.	Overusing chlorpyrifos (CPF) in tropical countries such as Costa Rica poses a potential risk to freshwater ecosystems. This study investigated the effects of transient exposure to an environmentally relevant CPF concentration on the native fish species Poecilia gillii, employing a comprehensive approach that evaluated multiple levels of biological organization. Using RT-qPCR, we quantified transcript changes in genes involved in various biological processes, including inflammation and apoptosis; annexin A1 (anxa1b), cytokine regulation; cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (cish), redox reactions; NADH oxidoreductase subunit A2 (ndufa2), protein translocation; Sec61 gamma subunit (sec61g), and biotransformation; glutathione S-transferase rho (gstr). Additionally, we measured biochemical biomarkers such as phase I; 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and phase II; glutathione S-transferase (GST) biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress markers; catalase (CAT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO), and conducted behavioral tests to assess swimming fitness and antipredator reactions. Neurotoxicity was assessed by measuring brain and muscle tissue cholinesterase (ChE) activity. Following 48 h of exposure to 5.5 µg/L CPF, we observed significant downregulation of the sec61g and gstr genes, decreased CAT activity, and neurotoxic effects, as indicated by reduced ChE activity in muscle. Although no significant behavioral changes were detected, our results suggest that short-term exposure to environmentally relevant CPF concentrations can disrupt gene expression, compromising biotransformation and protein synthesis in P. gillii juveniles. Moreover, the observed neurotoxicity, which is consistent with the mechanism of action of CPF, may lead to subtle behavioral changes. This study provides evidence of the sublethal effects of CPF on nontarget organisms, highlighting the importance of considering gene expression changes when assessing CPF toxicity.
39978000	Hierarchical structure of pyramid Si-ZnO NRs as reliable SALDI-MS platform for trace detection of pesticide.	Assessing agrochemical residues is crucial for food safety and consumer health. Surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SALDI-MS) has been proven to be efficient for pesticide detection, however its uneven substrate surface distribution limits its practical applicability. Improving detection sensitivity while maintaining detection repeatability is still challenging. In this study, a 3-D heterostructure integrated pyramid silicon and zinc oxide nanorods (pyramid Si-ZnO NRs) was proposed as a SALDI-MS substrate to enhance detection sensitivity and repeatability. The pyramid Si-ZnO NRs improve light trapping and hole-electron separation efficiency, significantly boosting SALDI-MS sensitivity. The limit of detections (LODs) for thiabendazole, imidacloprid, and berberine in beverages are respectively as low as 0.45 nM, 0.17 nM and 81 pM. The superhydrophobic substrate suppresses the "sweet spot" effect, improving repeatability with relative standard deviations (RSDs) under 10 %. This platform is a sensitive, reliable tool for detecting pesticide residues, with potential applications in food safety.
39977995	A three-in-one strategy of molecularly imprinted polymers-based electrochemical SERS for sensitive detection of acetamiprid in vegetables.	Selectively trapping analytes in complex matrices to hotspots and performing sensitive detection is an extremely important topic in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. Herein, a molecularly imprinted polymers-based electrochemical SERS (MIP-EC-SERS) sensor was proposed for detecting acetamiprid (AAP) residue. A polydopamine layer rich in imprinted cavities was fabricated on the surface of AuNPs/ITO, using an electropolymerization process, yielding a SERS substrate modified with MIP (MIP/AuNPs/ITO). Selective capture of AAP by imprinted cavities provided the initial signal enhancement. Subsequently, applying a potential of +0.3 V promoted interactions between AAP and SERS interface, further amplifying the SERS signals. The MIP-EC-SERS sensor achieved a limit of detection down to 3.2 nM and exhibited 13.6 times higher sensitivity than that without applied potential (43.5 nM). Importantly, the practical applicability of the sensor was confirmed by accurately testing AAP in vegetable samples, demonstrating promising application potential for food safety monitoring.

39977530	Resistance Risk and Novel Resistance-Related Point Mutations in Target Protein Cyt <i>b</i> of Florylpicoxamid in <i>Colletotrichum truncatum</i>.	Anthracnose, caused by <i>Colletotrichum truncatum</i>, is an economically important disease in soybean plants. Florylpicoxamid, a novel quinone inside inhibitor (QiI) fungicide, exhibits broad spectrum activity against pathogenic ascomycete fungi. However, little is known about the development of resistance risk to florylpicoxamid and the underlying mechanisms in <i>C. truncatum</i>. In the current study, the sensitivities of <i>C. truncatum</i> isolates to florylpicoxamid were characterized, with an average EC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.1540 ± 0.1642 μg/mL. Eleven florylpicoxamid-resistant mutants were obtained, which exhibited fitness comparable to that of the parental isolates. Florylpicoxamid treatment had a lesser impact on ATP production and the activity of the cytochrome <i>bc1</i> complex in the mutants compared to the parental isolates. Overall, <i>C. truncatum</i> has a medium resistance risk to florylpicoxamid. Additionally, cross-resistance was not observed between florylpicoxamid and the other fungicides tested herein. Three types of point mutations in the Cyt <i>b</i> protein, N31S/A37V, A37V, and S207P, were found to confer varying levels of resistance to florylpicoxamid in <i>C. truncatum</i>, as further proved by molecular docking.
39977252	Antimycin A induces light hypersensitivity of PSII in the presence of quinone QB-site binding herbicides.	Photosynthetic electron transport consists of linear electron flow and 2 cyclic electron flow (CEF) pathways around PSI (CEF-PSI). PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR5)-dependent CEF-PSI is thought to be the major CEF-PSI pathway and an important regulator of photosynthetic electron transfer. Antimycin A (AA) is commonly recognized as an inhibitor of PGR5-dependent CEF-PSI in photosynthesis. Although previous findings imply that AA may also affect PSII, which does not participate in CEF-PSI, these "secondary effects" tend to be neglected, and AA is often used for inhibition of PGR5-dependent CEF-PSI as if it were a specific inhibitor. Here, we investigated the direct effects of AA on PSII using isolated spinach (Spinacia oleracea) PSII membranes and thylakoid membranes isolated from spinach, Arabidopsis thaliana (wild-type Columbia-0 and PGR5-deficient mutant pgr5hope1), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Measurements of quinone QA- reoxidation kinetics showed that AA directly affects the acceptor side of PSII and inhibits electron transport within PSII. Furthermore, repetitive Fv/Fm measurements revealed that, in the presence of quinone QB-site binding inhibitors, AA treatment results in severe photodamage even from a single-turnover flash. The direct effects of AA on PSII are nonnegligible, and caution is required when using AA as an inhibitor of PGR5-dependent CEF-PSI. Meanwhile, we found that the commercially available compound AA3, which is a component of the AA complex, inhibits PGR5-dependent CEF-PSI without having notable effects on PSII. Thus, we propose that AA3 should be used instead of AA for physiological studies of the PGR5-dependent CEF-PSI.
39977185	Exposure to inorganic arsenic and hypertension among non-diabetic Mexican women.	To assess the association between hypertension (HTA) prevalence and the urinary levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) and its metabolites in north Mexican women without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
39976828	Prevalence of insecticide resistance and enhanced detoxifying enzymes in field populations of Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) in the major Tomato growing regions of South India.	South American pinworm Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) is an invasive and major tomato pest that attained resistance or reduced susceptibility to most insecticides used in their management due to repeated and intensive applications. This study aimed to find the levels of resistance in T. absoluta populations collected from South Indian states against novel insecticides such as chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC, flubendiamide 39.35% SC, spinosad 45% SC, indoxacarb 14.5% SC, and emamectin benzoate 5% SG using leaf dip bioassay. Among the eight populations collected from major tomato growing belts spanning three states of South India (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu), Krishnagiri of Tamil Nadu showed the highest level of resistance to flubendiamide and the least resistance was shown by the Tirupati population, with a resistance ratio of 174.89 and 2.24, respectively. Significant correlation was found between LC<sub>50</sub> values of flubendiamide and chlorantraniliprole (0.859), emamectin benzoate and flubendiamide (0.855) and spinosad and emamectin benzoate (0.866). The biochemical assay conducted to quantify the mixed function oxidase (MFO), carboxyl/choline esterase (CCE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the T. absoluta larval populations showed an increased level of MFO, CCE and GST in Krishnagiri population with 15.59, 1.72 and 6.02-fold, respectively compared to susceptible population. It showed that the detoxification enzyme plays an important role in the insecticide resistance of the field population of T. absoluta. The results serve as an initial assessment for further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance at the genetic level to design and implement successful insecticide resistance management strategies.
39976794	In vitro analysis of the activities of commercial anthelmintics in the presence of inhibitors of xenobiotic detoxification pathways in Haemonchus contortus exsheathed L3 stage.	Haemonchus contortus is a pathogenic nematode that infects small ruminants. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for these parasitic infections, but the rapid rise of drug resistance calls for the development of new anthelmintics. To support this, optimizing screening assays is vital for identifying new drugs. The exsheathed L3 (xL3) stage of H. contortus is often used in in vitro evaluations; however, it has been observed that it is less sensitive than the adult stage, possibly due to enhanced detoxification pathways. To explore this hypothesis, inhibitors of xenobiotic detoxification pathways were tested on the activity (IC<sub>50</sub>) of four anthelmintics-monepantel (MOP), levamisole (LEV), ivermectin (IVM), and albendazole sulfoxide (ABZ SO)-in xL3 using an automated motility assay. The inhibitors used were piperonyl butoxide (PBO) for phase I metabolism, 5-nitrouracil (5-NU) for phase II metabolism, and zosuquidar (ZOS) inhibiting efflux transport proteins. PBO increased MOP IC<sub>50</sub>, likely due to reduced formation of the active metabolite monepantel sulfone. IC<sub>50</sub> of MOP with 5-NU and IVM with PBO were both diminished, suggesting differences in metabolism between xL3 and the existing reports for the adult stage. Coincubation of LEV and IVM with ZOS also reduced IC<sub>50</sub>, confirming previous studies. ABZ SO was unaffected by the inhibitors. The use of inhibitors of xenobiotic detoxification pathways led to significant changes in the in vitro activity of the anthelmintics evaluated in H. contortus xL3 stage. Further studies, as ex vivo parasite diffusion assays in the xL3 stage, should be conducted to directly assess the impact on detoxification pathways.
39976770	Curcumin protects against MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by modulating the TRPV4 channel.	It is well acknowledged that neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress (OS) play a role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Curcumin (CUR) protect neuronal cells by interfering with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuronal cells and suppressing OS. In this study, we investigated the role of the TRPV4 channel under CUR stimulation in the PD model induced by MPP<sup>+</sup> in SH-SY5Y cells.
39976478	Lymphocyte subsets predict mortality in acute paraquat poisoning.	Paraquat (PQ) is a highly effective herbicide widely used in agricultural production, known for its strong herbicidal power, rapid action, and minimal environmental pollution. However, it is also highly toxic to humans and animals, with acute lung injury (ALI) being the primary cause of death. While the toxic mechanisms of PQ have been studied from various perspectives, its effects on lymphocytes and their subsets remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between lymphocyte dysfunction and mortality in acute PQ poisoning. A total of 92 patients with PQ poisoning who visited the emergency department of The Affiliated Lihuili Hospital of Ningbo University between January 1, 2016, and September 30, 2021, were included. Basic demographic and laboratory data within 24 h of admission were collected. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were analyzed using flow cytometry. To identify independent risk factors for mortality, patients were followed up for 90 days. COX proportional hazards models and LASSO regression were applied to screen for predictive variables and develop a predictive model. All participants provided informed consent, and the study was approved by the relevant ethics committee. Among the 92 patients, 36 died. Compared with the survival group, the death group showed significantly higher white blood cell and neutrophil counts, lymphocyte counts, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios, while the percentage of natural killer (NK) cells was significantly lower (P < 0.001). COX regression analysis identified these factors as independent risk factors for mortality: lymphocyte count: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-2.47; P = 0.04 neutrophil count: HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.18; P = 0.04 CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio: HR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.03-3.92; P = 0.04 NK cell percentage: HR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.95; P = 0.002. These findings suggest that lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio, and NK cell percentage are all associated with mortality in PQ poisoning cases.

39975837	Examine the impact of green-synthesized nanomaterials on the germination rates and seedling characteristics of African Marigold (<i>Tagetes erecta</i> L. var. Pusa Narangi Ganda and Pusa Basanti Ganda).	West Bengal is key to India's flower industry, contributing 10.61 % of total production, with marigolds valued at 63.44 thousand tonnes. To achieve good yields, many farmers heavily use chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Marigold seeds typically germinate in about 14 days, but farmers often face issues with uneven germination and poor seedling quality.
39975817	Diversity of <i>Stemphylium</i> spp. of onion and garlic revealed the differential pathogenicity and <i>in vitro</i> efficacy of different growth suppressors.	Stemphylium blight of onion and garlic, induced by <i>Stemphylium vesicarium</i>, is a serious concern in Bangladesh due to the devastation and economic loss. Twenty isolates of <i>Stemphylium</i> spp. From different locations were collected and their cultural, morphological, molecular, and pathological diversity were analyzed. Cultural variations were distinct having the maximum radial mycelial growth (43.00 mm) and the minimum (37.13 mm) at the end of colonization. Prominent diversity was also found in colony textures, elevations, shapes, and colors of the conidia. Molecular identification was done for precise recognition and delineation. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified using the universal primers ITS1 and ITS4 which provided an amplicon of 600 bp. Further, all PCR products were sequenced to find the homology with the GenBank accessions of NCBI. Different isolates showed 82.92-100.00 % similarity with <i>S. vesicarium</i> and <i>S. lycopersici</i>. The phylogeny of the <i>Stemphylium</i> isolates indicated the presence of two distinct species of <i>Stemphylium</i> where 18 isolates exhibited similarity with <i>S. vesicarium</i> and 2 isolates were associated with <i>S. lycopersici</i>. Isolate GNMM-42 (OR923573) had the highest virulence. Salicylic acid (SA), benzoic acid (BA), and chitosan (CHI) exhibited <i>in vitro</i> antifungal effects against <i>S. vesicarium</i>. However, chitosan @ 40 ppm exhibited the most significant growth inhibitory effect (98.78 %). The findings indicate that <i>S. vesicarium</i> was the predominant species that caused the Stemphylium blight in onion and garlic. A considerable variation exists in cultural, morphological, molecular, and pathological characteristics among the <i>Stemphylium</i> isolates. Additionally, SA, BA, and CHI showed growth suppressive effects and can be utilized as alternative compounds to toxic fungicides in the existing integrated disease management package in Bangladesh.

39974150	Assessment of fall armyworm tolerant maize hybrids for sustainable maize production in sub-Saharan Africa.	Fall armyworm (<i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> (J.E. Smith)) has become a significant pest to maize production, causing huge yield losses in sub-Saharan Africa. This study evaluated three non-Bt maize hybrids with tolerance to fall armyworm (FAW) along with a commercial hybrid check for yield and agronomic performance under natural FAW infestation and chemical control conditions in both on-station and on-farm trials. Significant differences were observed among the hybrids with the FAW tolerant hybrids showing reduced leaf and ear damage compared to the commercial hybrid. These hybrids also exhibited high grain yield performance, outyielding the commercial check by 197-252%. Mean grain yield under FAW infestation ranged from 6009.88 to 7117.30 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> without chemical control, and even higher (8441.24 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) under limited chemical control. Stepwise multiple regression analyses identified ear aspect, husk cover and ear damage as key traits accounting for 98% of the total variation in grain yield under FAW infestation. Participatory variety selection showed high farmer preference for these hybrids. The availability of these hybrids to farmers promises to enhance food security, reduce the environmental impact of insecticides, alleviate cost burdens on farmers, and increase household income.
39973912	Evaluation of confirmatory data following the Article 12 MRL review for terbuthylazine.	The applicant Syngenta Crop Protection AG submitted a request to the competent national authority in Spain to evaluate the confirmatory data that were identified for the active substance terbuthylazine in the framework of the maximum residue level (MRL) review under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 as not available. Based on the information provided by the applicant and assessed by Spain, EFSA concludes that the tentative MRL is confirmed in sweet corn and sunflower seeds, but not in lupins/lupini beans and cotton seeds. Regarding livestock metabolism study, EFSA acknowledges that a new goat metabolism study was submitted. However, due to the shortcomings identified, the metabolism in ruminants cannot be fully depicted. Despite these deficiencies, it can be concluded that at the calculated maximum dietary burdens significant transfer of residues in bovine tissues and milk is not expected and therefore the tentative MRLs can be confirmed. The consumer risk assessment performed in the framework of the MRL review was updated using revision 3.1. of the PRIMo, considering the actual MRL values implemented in Regulation (EU) 2021/1795 and excluding the crops on which the uses are not supported by Article 12 confirmatory data (cotton seed and lupins/lupini beans). No consumer intake concerns were identified.
39972750	Understanding pesticide-induced tipping in plant-pollinator networks across geographical scales: Prioritizing richness and modularity over nestedness.	Mutually beneficial interactions between plants and pollinators are crucial for biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and crop production. A threat to a mutualistic network is the occurrence of a tipping point at which the species abundances collapse to a near zero level. In modern agriculture, there is widespread use of pesticides. What are the effects of extensive pesticide use on mutualistic networks? We develop a plant-pollinator-pesticide model and study its dynamics using 123 mutualistic networks across the globe. We demonstrate that pesticide exposure can lead to a tipping point. Furthermore, while the network characteristics such as richness and modularity exhibit a strong association with pesticide-induced tipping, nestedness shows a weak association. A surprising finding is that the mutualistic networks in the African continent are less pesticide tolerant than those in Europe. We articulate and test a pragmatic intervention strategy through targeted management of pesticide levels within specific plant species to delay or avert the tipping point. Our study provides quantitative insights into the phenomenon of pesticide-induced tipping for safeguarding mutualistic networks that are fundamental to agriculture and ecosystems.
39972684	Genomic, Transcriptomic and Suspect/Non-Target Screening Analyses Reveal the Role of CYP450s in the Degradation of Imazalil and Delineate Its Transformation Pathway by Cladosporium herbarum.	Imazalil (IMZ), a major surface water contaminant characterised by high environmental recalcitrance and toxicity, is used in fruit-packaging plants to control fungal infestations during storage. This leads to the production of wastewaters which should be treated on site before their environmental release. We previously isolated a Cladosporium herbarum strain, the first microorganism that could degrade IMZ. Here we describe the genetic network utilised by the fungus to degrade IMZ and its detailed transformation. Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of C. herbarum pointed to the involvement of strongly upregulated CYP450s in IMZ degradation, as further verified by cessation of its biodegradation by CYP450 inhibitors. LC-QTOF-HRMS analysis and suspect/non-target screening identified nine transformation products (TPs) of IMZ. IMZ biotransformation mainly proceeded through O-dealkylation, while other less important paths, most probably controlled by upregulated oxidases, were operative involving successive hydroxylation reactions. These lead to the formation of TPs like IMZ_313 and IMZ_331, with the former being further transformed through imidazole ring scission to IMZ_288, a TP reported for the first time. We provide first evidence for the transformation mechanism of IMZ by C. herbarum and the potential genes/enzymes involved, paving the way for the use of C. herbarum in the biodepuration of agro-industrial effluents.
39972676	EBNA1 Targeted Ultra-Small Near-Infrared Persistent Luminescent Nano-Inhibitor for Theranostics of EBV-Associated Cancer.	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a well-recognized oncogenic virus that promotes several lymphoid and epithelial cancers. The Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), which is known to be expressed in all EBV-positive cancers, plays a vital role in viral genome replication and maintenance and is therefore emerged as an attractive target for clinical intervention. Several EBNA1 inhibitors have shown potency in the growth inhibition of EBV-positive cancers, yet low bioavailability and in vivo unmonitored nature hamper their further implementation. Here a novel EBNA1 nano-inhibitor based on EBNA1-specific peptide inhibitor (P4) functionalized ZnGa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:Cr<sup>3+</sup> ultra-small near-infrared persistent luminescent (NIR-PL) nanoparticles (ZGOC-P4) is developed. Owing to the specific binding to EBNA1, ZGOC-P4 nano-inhibitor can quickly achieve nuclear internalization in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells (C666-1) and selectively inhibit their growth. In sharp contrast, ZGOC-P4 nano-inhibitor shows no inhibition effect on EBV-negative NPC cells (HK-1). Moreover, the results indicate that the well-designed nano-inhibitor enables efficient tumor-targeting accumulation in NPC xenograft model under the monitoring of autofluorescence interference-free NIR-PL imaging in vivo and suppresses EBV-associated tumor growth with an inhibition rate of 61.6%. This work highlights the potency of ZGOC-P4 on NPC treatment and may provide new sight into future research on EBV-associated diseases.
39972520	Reprogrammed Plant Metabolism During Viral Infections: Mechanisms, Pathways and Implications.	Plant viruses pose a significant threat to global agriculture, leading to substantial crop losses that jeopardise food security and disrupt ecosystem stability. These viral infections often reprogramme plant metabolism, compromising key pathways critical for growth and defence. For instance, infections by cucumber mosaic virus alter amino acid and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, including flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathways, thereby weakening plant defences. Similarly, tomato bushy stunt virus disrupts lipid metabolism by altering the synthesis and accumulation of sterols and phospholipids, which are essential for viral replication and compromise membrane integrity. Recent advancements in gene-editing technologies, such as CRISPR/Cas9, and metabolomics offer innovative strategies to mitigate these impacts. Precise genetic modifications can restore or optimise disrupted metabolic pathways, enhancing crop resilience to viral infections. Metabolomics further aids in identifying metabolic biomarkers linked to viral resistance, guiding breeding programmes aimed at developing virus-resistant plants. By reducing the susceptibility of crops to viral infections, these approaches hold significant potential to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides, increase crop yields and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Future research should focus on expanding our understanding of virus-host interactions at the molecular level while exploring the long-term ecological impacts of viral infections. Interdisciplinary approaches integrating multi-omics technologies and sustainable management strategies will be critical in addressing the challenges posed by plant viruses and ensuring global agricultural stability.
39971983	Gene expression atlas of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).	The Colorado potato beetle (CPB) is a major pest of potato crops, known for its remarkable ability to develop resistance to more than 50 pesticides. For decades, CPB has served as a model species for studying insecticide resistance, insect physiology, diapause, reproduction, and evolution. However, research progress on CPB has been hindered by the lack of comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic resources. Here, leveraging a recently established chromosome-level genome assembly, we constructed a gene expression atlas of CPB using transcriptomic data from 61 samples representing major organs and developmental stages. By integrating short- and long-read sequencing technologies, we enhanced the genome annotation and identified 6,623 additional genes that were previously undetected. Furthermore, we developed a web portal to facilitate the search and visualization of the gene expression atlas, providing an accessible resource for the research community. The CPB gene expression atlas offers valuable tools and comprehensive data that will accelerate future research in pest control and insect biology.
39971905	Phenazine-1-carboxylic Acid Has a Broad-Spectrum Antifungal Effect by Targeting Isocitrate Lyase.	Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), as a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, showed significant resistance against the Apple Valsa canker caused by <i>Valsa mali</i> (<i>V. mali</i>). Therefore, it is of great importance to reveal the functions and mechanisms of PCA in plant pathogens, which would provide potential targets for crop disease control. In this study, we identified the major contribution of PCA in the resistance of <i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</i> subsp. <i>aureofaciens</i> W9-1 to <i>V. mali</i> by gene knockout and high-performance liquid chromatography. Subsequently, we demonstrated that PCA could target isocitrate lyase (ICL) to exert a broad-spectrum antifungal effect by molecular docking, microscale thermophoresis, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis shows that PCA alters the lipid balance at the cell membrane of <i>V. mali</i>. In summary, this study demonstrates that PCA has a broad-spectrum antifungal effect by targeting the ICL, which may be a potential target for the development and utilization of fungicides.
39971813	In vitro cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of boric acid on endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines (HEC-1B and Ischikawa).	Endometrial carcinoma, the most common malignancy of the female genital tract, remains challenging to treat despite early-stage dominance. Surgical interventions and irradiation are insufficient for advanced endometrial cancer. Our aim was to investigate to explore the in vitro cytotoxicity and apoptotic effects of boric acid (BA) on endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines (Ishikawa and HEC-1B cell lines), providing experimental evidence for the potential application of boric acid as an anticancer drug. Time- and dose-dependent cell viability was determined with the XTT cell proliferation test. Differences in mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR using cDNAs and SYBR green assay. Colony formation and the effect of BA on wound healing were evaluated. Immunocytochemistry and TUNEL tests were performed to evaluate apoptosis. BA increased the expression of Caspase 3 and Bax in HEC-1B and Ischikawa cell lines. It was determined that BA significantly decreased the number of colonies in both cell lines (p < 0.05). In HEC-1B and Ishikawa cell lines, there was an increase in cell migration in the control group at 16 and 24 h. The apoptotic index was higher in the BA group, although it was not statistically significant. According to immunohistochemistry results, Caspase 3 and Bax expression in HEC-1B and Ishikawa cell lines were statistically increased in BA group. The expression of Bcl-2 was decreased statistically with BA treatment in both cell lines (p = 0.0001). BA treatment inhibited cell migration and colony formation, which are important for carcinogenesis, in endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines. This inhibition was shown to occur through the apoptotic pathway.
39971727	Metabolic Engineering of <i>Rhodotorula toruloides</i> for the Production of Linalool.	Linalool is widely used in foods, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Microbial production offers a sustainable alternative to current plant extraction and chemical synthesis. In the present study, the oleaginous yeast <i>Rhodotorula toruloides</i> was metabolically engineered for linalool production. Overall, an integrated strategy involving linalool synthase selection, promoter screening, and pathway enhancement was implemented. The linalool biosynthesis baseline was established by using a 51 aa-truncated linalool synthase from <i>Mentha citrate</i> (t51<i>Mc</i>LIS). The linalool titer was increased to 249.7 mg/L by optimizing the expression of critical enzymes with native promoters. Then, it was improved to 790.2 mg/L by manipulating the mevalonate pathway and further elevated to 845.1 mg/L (42.3 mg/g glucose) by optimizing the fermentation conditions in shake flasks. Finally, the linalool production was enhanced to 2.59 g/L and 26.9 mg/g glucose in a 3 L bioreactor. The results demonstrated the potential of <i>R. toruloides</i> for the microbial production of monoterpenes.
39971723	Environmental health risk assessment of chlorpyrifos near a pesticide enterprise in East China.	This study presents the results of an environment investigation and monitoring of chlorpyrifos contamination in the vicinity of a pesticide enterprise in East China, focusing on its relation to environmental and human health risks. The impact zone of chlorpyrifos is particularly pronounced within approximately 2 km of the enterprise. The highest levels of outdoor dust were observed in SP1, which is closest to the enterprise. The individual health risk of exposure to chlorpyrifos through different media - such as indoor air, rice, vegetables, drinking water and indoor dust - was assessed following the procedure defined by the USEPA. The non-carcinogenic risks to both adults and children do not exceed the permissible standard of 1, suggesting no non-carcinogenic risks due to chlorpyrifos exposure. However, the average daily dose calculated by exposure assessment model shows that children are exposed to higher doses of chlorpyrifos compared to adults due to their lifestyle habits and play patterns.
39971716	Iridium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Boron Enolates to Construct Acyclic All-Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters.	Enolates are ubiquitous intermediates in organic synthesis. Among them, boron enolates exhibit distinctive reactivity patterns and selectivities due to the presence of a boron atom, making their synthesis highly attractive. Although methods for accessing ketone- or ester-derived boron enolates are well-developed, much less progress has been made in the development of aldehyde-derived boron enolates due to aldehydes' high tendency toward self-condensation. Therefore, the practical applications of aldehyde-derived boron enolates are significantly hindered. We present herein an efficient method for the preparation of aldehyde-derived boron enolates via the 1,2-hydroboration of ketenes with boranes, avoiding the use of acidic R<sub>2</sub>BCl/R<sub>2</sub>BOTf and bases and leading to improved functional group tolerance. Utilizing this convenient protocol, we developed an Ir-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of boron enolates, yielding a wide array of chiral aldehydes bearing acyclic all-carbon quaternary centers with high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity, which are prevalent in various natural products and bioactive molecules. The synthetic utility and practicality of this method are demonstrated through gram-scale reactions and asymmetric syntheses of the ent-5HT1 A antagonist as well as biological activity studies in inhibiting the growth of plant pathogens.
39971138	Afzelechin alleviates deltamethrin induced hepatic dysfunction via regulating TLR4/MyD88, HMGB1/RAGE and NF-κB pathway.	Deltamethrin (DMN) is a type-II pyrethroid that has been documented to instigate numerous organ toxicities. Afzelechin (ALN) is a plant based polyphenolic compound that exhibits marvelous biological properties. The present research was conducted to assess the alleviative potential of ALN against DMN induced hepatic dysregulations. Thirty-six male albino (Sprague Dawley) rats were apportioned into four random groups including the control, DMN (5mgkg<sup>-1</sup>), DMN (5mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) + ALN (2mgkg<sup>-1</sup>), and ALN (2mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) alone administrated group. ALN protected hepatic tissues against DMN induced oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. ALN supplementation donwregulated the gene expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), high mobility group box1 (HMGB1), tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α), Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor- kappa B (NF-κB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Besides, ALN administration reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde while increasing the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GSR), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). The levels of hepatic function markers including GGT, ALT, ALP, and AST were lowered while the concentrations of albumin and total proteins were promoted following the ALN treatment. The levels of Bax, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 were suppressed while the levels of Bcl-2 were escalated after ALN therapy. Moreover, ALN treatment remarkably mitigated DMN induced histological impairments. These findings highlight the hepatoprotective efficacy of ALN against DMN induced liver toxicity.
39971115	Valorization of organic fruit peel wastes for Aedes aegypti control: A green chemistry approach integrating in vitro and in silico studies.	Vector-borne diseases affect millions of people worldwide, with a significant impact on children below five years. The infections transmitted by mosquitoes cause an estimate of 219 million cases globally, resulting in more than 400,000 deaths every year. As per WHO protocol, spraying of synthetic larvicides over the stagnant drainages and water systems is being one of the most common and effective techniques in the process of disease control. In parallel, the awareness on organic waste pollution had led to the increased practice of sustainable valorization to tackle daily needs. The present study focuses on mixed fruit peel liquid (MFPL) production through anaerobic fermentation of fruit peel wastes and evaluation of its larvicidal efficacy against Aedes aegypti. The in vitro assay revealed that higher concentrations of MFPL and exposure period increased larval mortality, with LC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.4% at 6 h to 0.3% at 24 h. Among the twenty bioactive compounds identified through GC-MS analysis of MFPL, n-hexadecanoic acid,2(1H) - quinolinone hydrazone and benzofuran, had significant glide scores of. -12.3 kcal/mol, -7.1 kcal/mol and -5.7 kcal/mol against the target protein 1PZ4 and -11.1 kcal/mol, -7.2 kcal/mol and -5.2 kcal/mol against 1YIY during molecular docking. The stability and interactions of three bioactive compounds were then assessed using DFT and molecular dynamics simulations, in which n-hexadecanoic acid was significantly stable with optimal hydrogen bond interactions. The novel findings of the study confirm MFPL's potential as an effective larvicide which could substitute commercial larvicides that are harmful to the ecosystem.
39971104	Anaerobic sequencing batch reactor for concurrent removal of multiple recalcitrant munition compounds.	Large-scale production, use, and disposal of munitions has resulted in widespread environmental contamination. A laboratory-scale anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (AnSBR) was initiated in this study to investigate the concurrent removal of multiple energetic compounds that comprise modern munition formulations. The AnSBR achieved high removal efficiencies of 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN, >99%) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX, 84 ± 16%), along with the partial removal of 1-nitroguanidine (NQ, 30 ± 27%). Specific DNAN, RDX, and NQ removal rates of 17.0 ± 0.1 µmol DNAN/g VSS/d, 22.0 ± 0.8 µmol RDX/g VSS/d, and 2.0 ± 0.3 µmol NQ/g VSS/d were recorded in the AnSBR under steady-state conditions, respectively. Long-term operation of the AnSBR selected Actinobacteria (2 - 58%) and uncultured Actinomycetaceae (1 - 58%) as the most abundant phylum and genus, respectively. Results from this study provide valuable insights into the development of anaerobic bioreactors for the remediation of sites impacted by modern munitions.
39970668	Differences in microbial communities and phosphorus cycles between rural and urban lakes: Based on glyphosate and AMPA effects.	The widespread availability of glyphosate in shallow lakes is of significant concern. Glyphosate is an organophosphorus pesticide that can affect the phosphorus cycle and microbial communities in lakes. However, the effects of glyphosate on lakes in different geographical locations remain unclear. This study not only investigated glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) residues in sediments from rural and urban lakes, but also examined differences in the effects of these substances on lake microbial communities and phosphorus cycles. Glyphosate and AMPA were detected in 100% of sediments from the three rural and three urban lakes surveyed. Glyphosate concentrations were not significantly different among all lake sediments; however, AMPA concentrations were significantly higher in rural lake sediments than in urban lake sediments (P < 0.05). The abundance of the glpC gene, encoding an organophosphorus-degrading enzyme, and the abundance of Luteitalea sp. TBR-22, which is enriched for the glpC gene, were significantly different between rural and urban lake sediments (P < 0.05). Notably, the abundance of glpC and Luteitalea sp. TBR-22 was significantly and positively correlated with AMPA concentration (P < 0.05). In addition, the AMPA concentration was significantly and positively correlated with the O-bonded inorganic phosphate (Pi) content (P < 0.05). These results suggest that high AMPA concentrations in rural lake sediments may increase the production of O-bonded Pi in lake sediments by controlling the expression of glpC in Luteitalea sp. TBR-22, leading to higher concentrations of O-bonded Pi in the rural lake sediments than in the urban lake sediments.
39970641	A "three-in-one" detection platform based on cerium-coated metal-organic framework for multimodal glyphosate detection.	Glyphosate (Glyp) is a widely used herbicide, but its through prolonged and excessive spraying residues pose significant health risks. A ratiometric multimodal sensing platform combining fluorescence, colorimetry, and photothermal detection was developed for Glyp detection using a cerium/polyacrylic acid-modified porphyrin-based metal-organic framework (PCN@PAA-Ce). The detection strategy relies on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by Glyp, the oxidase-like activity of PCN@PAA-Ce, and the competition between enzymatic products and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). Glyp inhibits acetylcholinesterase, which prevents the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine and the production of reduced thiocholine. The oxidase-like property of PCN@PAA-Ce facilitates the oxidation of TMB (colorless) to oxidized TMB (oxTMB) (blue-green), while fluorescence resonance energy transfer caused oxTMB to quench the red fluorescence of PCN@PAA-Ce. Under ultraviolet light, the probe solution exhibits yellow-green fluorescence as a reference signal. Additionally, the excellent photothermal conversion of oxTMB enables the probe to respond to Glyp through photothermal responses. The detection ranges in the three modes were 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> to 4 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup> to 6 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, and 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup> to 6 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, with detection limits of 9.85 × 10<sup>-6</sup> mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, 8.69 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, and 9.72 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Compared to a single-mode probe, the multimodal probe's self-verification function provides more accurate and stable detection, offering broader potential for application.
39970485	Discovery of niclosamide as a p300/transcription factor protein-protein interaction inhibitor.	Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are crucial in various biological processes and are attractive targets for drug discovery. In this study, we identified niclosamide (9) as a novel inhibitor of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)/p300 PPI from the RIKEN NPDepo compound library using a fluorescence anisotropy-based screening method. We synthesized niclosamide azide (10) as a photoaffinity labelling probe to identify the p300 binding site of compound 9 and elucidated the binding mode using photoaffinity labelling experiments and molecular docking simulations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that compound 9 inhibited not only HIF-1α/p300 PPI but also p300-transcription factor PPIs, including interaction with p53 and STAT3, thereby suppressing the expression of BAX and c-MYC, respectively.
39970365	Demographic Variation In US Outpatient Hydroxychloroquine And Ivermectin Use During The COVID-19 Pandemic.	As COVID-19 surged across the US starting in 2020, so too did the use of repurposed medications such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin to treat COVID-19 infections. Use of these medications throughout the public health emergency and across demographic subgroups is not well understood. Using insurance claims from the MedInsight Emerging Experience Research Database for 8.1 million patients from all fifty US states, we evaluated COVID-19-associated outpatient hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin use and spending throughout the public health emergency (January 30, 2020-May 11, 2023) versus pre-public health emergency rates. Extrapolated to the US population, approximately three million prescriptions (totaling $272 million in spending) were used; 7 percent followed Food and Drug Administration authorization of outpatient COVID-19 medications ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, molnupiravir, and remdesivir in December 2021 and January 2022. The combined overall hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin utilization rate was threefold higher in older versus younger adults. Ivermectin use was greater among patients with the highest versus the lowest degree of social vulnerability and in the southern US versus other regions. These findings can inform policy efforts to mitigate the harms of non-evidence-based care, particularly among vulnerable populations.
39970341	Rapid and simple detection of anilinopyrimidine resistance in <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> by combining recombinase polymerase amplification with the CRISPR/Cas12a assay.	Anilinopyrimidine (AP) fungicides have been widely adopted to control Botrytis cinerea since the 1990s. As a high-risk pathogen for the development of fungicide resistance, B. cinerea developed resistance to AP fungicides soon after their application. To ensure the proper use of these fungicides, it is necessary to establish a rapid and simple method for resistance detection. Our previous study demonstrated that the E407K mutation in Bcmdl1 was the major mutation conferring AP resistance in China. Based on the combination of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and CRISPR/Cas12a nucleic acid detection assay (RPA/Cas12a detection assay), a simple method for the rapid detection of AP resistance was established by specifically identifying this resistance-related mutation. The new detection assay could precisely identify the E407K mutants from other mutants and wild-type isolates within 50 minutes, relying solely on a water/metal bath and a UV flashlight. Moreover, this assay could detect genomic DNA at concentration as low as 1.8 × 106 fg/μL, which is comparable with conventional PCR, indicating its high sensitivity. High specificity among different species were also observed in this assay. Above all, this assay was compatible with a two-minute DNA extraction method, implying its feasibility for field application. In conclusion, the RPA/Cas12a detection assay developed in this study is rapid and simple, making it an ideal method for AP resistance detection in local agencies and other points of care. Instant information on resistance monitoring can provide important guidance on resistance management.
39970110	Thermotherapy via aerated steam is an effective alternative for non-chemical management of cryptic infection of strawberry by <i>Colletotrichum acutatum</i>.	Annual strawberry production in Florida is threatened by anthracnose, caused by <i>Colletotrichum acutatum</i>. This disease is often transmitted through quiescently infected transplants from strawberry nurseries. Managing anthracnose has become even more difficult in both nursery and fruit production fields since the rise of strains resistant to <i>QoI</i> fungicides. In this study, thermotherapy was evaluated as a potential alternative to manage the disease by reducing inoculum in plant stock. Initial laboratory assessments demonstrated that the germination of <i>C. acutatum</i> spores was entirely suppressed upon exposure to 44°C for 120 min, 48°C for 10 min, or 52°C for 5 min. Conversely, a minor proportion of <i>C. acutatum</i> spores (less than 10%) sustained viability, even after being subjected to 40°C for 240 min. Heat treatment of strawberry transplants at 44°C for 240 min, with or without a preheating step (37°C for 1 h), via aerated steam, significantly reduced the colonization of petioles by <i>C. acutatum</i>. Early season harvest data from field trials showed that heat-treated plants, with or without a pre-heating phase, had considerably lower fruit disease incidence and higher yield than the nontreated controls. These findings suggest that heat treatment via aerated steam might be a viable means to decrease C. acutatum inoculum in strawberry transplants, thereby reducing anthracnose in fruit-producing areas.
39970108	Early-season predictions of aerial spores to enhance infection model efficacy for Cercospora leaf spot management in sugarbeet.	<i>Cercospora beticola</i> causes one of the most destructive foliar diseases of sugarbeet in many growing regions. Management of Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) relies heavily on timely and repeated fungicide applications. Current treatment initiation is often supported by models predicting conditions favorable for infection; however, these models lack information of <i>C. beticola</i> presence and abundance. Burkard volumetric mechanical samplers and highly CLS-susceptible sentinel beets (biological samplers) were used to assess early-season aerial <i>C. beticola</i> conidia from sugarbeet fields in Michigan and in Ontario, Canada from 2019-2022. In initial correlation and logistic regression analyses (n=449), duration of leaf wetness, air temperature, and wind speed were found to predict the risk of elevated <i>Cercospora</i> spore concentrations with 67.9% accuracy. In 2022 and 2023, a select model and a limited set of action thresholds, in addition to the BEETcast model, were tested for fungicide application timing. When CLS pressure was high, extending the interval between applications showed reduced management of CLS (<i>P</i> < 0.001), sugar percentage, and RWS (<i>P</i> < 0.05) compared to the grower standard. Model-based programs integrating canopy closure information resulted in CLS, yield, and sugar metrics comparable to the grower standard despite one less fungicide application. In additional training analysis (n=402), an ensemble model included leaf wetness, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed variables with a testing accuracy of 73.2% (n=101). Based on model development, refinement, and validation, assessment of elevated early-season <i>C. beticola</i> presence and abundance has potential to improve application timing and efficacy for preventative CLS management.
39970081	A Novel Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) Reduces <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> Infection in <i>Glycine max</i> Seedlings.	Over the past five years, seedling diseases have caused an average annual loss of $21.8 million dollars' worth of United States' soybean (<i>Glycine max</i> (L.) Merr.) production, with <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> (teleomorph <i>Gibberella zeae</i> (Schwein.) Petch) emerging as a significant threat within the seedling disease complex. Its cross-pathogenicity on wheat and maize, along with increasing reports of fungicide resistance, highlights the need for improved genetic resistance in soybean. In a previous germplasm screening and genome-wide association study (GWAS) we identified a significantly resistant accession, PI 438500, from a panel of 208 diverse soybean accessions. This accession carried fewer marker-trait associations (MTAs) and lower predicted resistance than other significantly resistant accessions yet displayed a highly resistant phenotype with low standard deviations. In this study, we developed an F<sub>2:3</sub> mapping population from a bi-parental cross between PI 438500 and PI 548631 (highly susceptible to <i>F. graminearum</i>) and identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that explains 20.29% of the variation in post-emergent visual severity. This QTL region contains multiple candidate genes with predicted roles in plant defense mechanisms and helps elucidate PI 438500's significant resistance to <i>F. graminearum</i>. Molecular markers linked and within this QTL region can help facilitate marker-assisted selection for <i>F. graminearum</i> resistance in soybean breeding.
39970055	Two volatiles from anthracnose-infected blueberries trigger electrophysiological and aversive behavioral responses in Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae).	Native to Southeast Asia, the spotted-wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii Matsumura) is an economically important invasive pest of thin-skinned fruits such as raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries worldwide. To reduce the reliance on insecticides for managing this pest, alternative strategies like behavioral manipulation are needed. Previous studies have shown that D. suzukii adults avoid blueberry fruits infected with the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum fioriniae Marcelino & Gouli, which causes anthracnose fruit rot, leading to the identification of 9 potential repellent compounds. In this study, we further investigated the two most potent of these compounds-ethyl butanoate and ethyl (E)-but-2-enoate-to assess their repellent properties on the antennal and behavioral responses of D. suzukii. Electroantennogram (EAG) assays revealed that both esters elicited similar dose-dependent responses in male and female D. suzukii, which were often stronger than those triggered by 2-pentylfuran, a known repellent of this species. Additionally, we examined the behavioral responses of adult D. suzukii to these 3 repellent compounds under semi-field and field conditions using outdoor cages containing potted and planted blueberry bushes, respectively. Results from the cage studies showed that all 3 tested compounds can significantly reduce D. suzukii oviposition and adult emergence from blueberry fruits, with ethyl (E)-but-2-enoate sometimes outperforming the other compounds. Our findings indicate that the esters ethyl butanoate and ethyl (E)-but-2-enoate, which are induced from C. fioriniae-infected blueberries, elicit dose-dependent effects on D. suzukii antennae and act as effective oviposition deterrents. This supports their potential as promising tools for managing this pest through behavioral strategies.
39969986	Wetland pesticide exposure in agricultural regions: A case study from Uruguay.	The intensification of agricultural practices has led to an increased reliance on pesticides, which has become a significant environmental concern due to their adverse effects on ecosystems and human health. In Uruguay, the escalation of pesticide use has been accompanied by detrimental effects on ecosystems critical for conservation. Understanding the dynamics of these widespread pollutants necessitates an in-depth comprehension of the application of active ingredients, their spatial distribution, and their environmental fate. This study aims to assess the exposure of wetland ecosystems in Uruguay's primary agricultural zone to pesticides. The research integrates remote sensing techniques to identify crop rotations, determining the predominant active ingredients and their rates of use in agricultural cycles, estimating pesticide distribution patterns and environmental mobility, and evaluating wetland exposure. The study reveals widespread use of active chemicals such as glyphosate, 24-D, flumioxazin, S-metolachlor, clethodim, flumetsulam, triflumuron, chlorantraniliprole, and fipronil, with 27.4% of wetland areas experiencing significant exposure. This study provides a comprehensive method for georeferencing pesticide applications, estimating spatial distribution, and assessing wetland vulnerability to agricultural chemicals, offering valuable insights for environmental management and policy-making.
39969401	Development and validation of a combined QuEChERS and HPLC-MS/MS method for trace analysis of ten diamide insecticides in agricultural products.	Diamide insecticides are being widely registered worldwide, yet most of them lack established maximum residue limits (MRLs) in agricultural products. In this study, we combined a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, efficient, rugged, and safe) extraction method with high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis to simultaneously identify and quantify ten diamide insecticides in seven matrices for the first time. The method was validated in accordance with SANTE/11312/2021 guidelines, including sensitivity, linearity, trueness, and precision. Excellent linearity (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> > 0.99) was obtained for all diamide insecticides within the concentration range of 5-1000 µg kg<sup>-1</sup>. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.01-1 µg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 5 µg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The recoveries of the ten diamide insecticides at three levels (5, 100, and 1000 µg kg<sup>-1</sup>) ranged from 76.6% to 108.2% with good intra-day relative standard deviation (RSD<sub>r</sub>) (1.0-13.4%) and inter-day relative standard deviation (RSD<sub>R</sub>) (2.3-15.7%). The proposed method was applied to analyze 70 real agricultural product samples, and only six samples contained diamide insecticides. The results demonstrated that the method was both convenient and reliable for detecting diamide insecticides in agricultural products. The method was then applied to analyze agricultural product samples collected in a field trial to estimate the MRLs for the next step.
39969044	Small Molecule Fluorescent Probes for Glutathione S-Transferase.	Cytoplasmic glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a key enzyme in cellular detoxification, catalysing the nucleophilic attack of glutathione (GSH) with toxic electrophilic substrates to produce less harmful compounds, thus aiding cellular detoxification. Studies have shown that GST is closely associated with the development of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, pesticides, herbicides and antibiotics, and the development of drug resistance in organisms poses new challenges in areas such as environmental protection and tumour therapy. In order to clarify the mechanism of GST in the development of drug resistance and detect the content of GST more accurately, this paper summarized the mechanism of GST on the development of drug resistance in different organisms, the types and research progress of organic small molecule fluorescence probes for GST imaging detection are introduced.
39968997	Preliminary phytochemical screening and antioxidant activity of Annona deceptrix (Westra) H. Rainer an endemic and endangered species of Ecuador.	Annona deceptrix (Westra) H. Rainer belongs to the Annonaceae family which is known to have bioactivities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflamatory, pesticide, among others. A. deceptrix ethanolic seed and leaf extracts obtained by three extraction methods (Soxhlet, ultrasound, and maceration) were tested for phytochemical and antioxidant activities. Phytochemical screening of plant extracts revealed the presence of catechins, triterpenes, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, amino acids, cardiac glycosides, anthocyanidins, reducing sugars, and saponins. Quantitative determination of total phenolic, flavonoid contents, and antioxidant activities of extracts was carried out using colorimetric methods. The highest total phenolic content was 58.14 and 54.08 mg GAE/g DW for Soxhlet extracts from leaves and seeds, respectively. The highest total flavonoid content was 5.03 and 4.42 mg QE/ g DW for macerated and ultrasound-assisted extracts from leaves, respectively. Antioxidant activity by the DPPH method was 196.07 and 146.53 μmol TE/g DW for Soxhlet extracts from seeds and leaves, respectively, and by the ABTS method was 582.68 and 580.40 μmol TE/g DW for Soxhlet and macerated extracts from leaves, respectively. Further research is needed to optimize the use of such bioactive compounds produced by Annona deceptrix and apply their biological activities in the pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, or agrochemical industries.
39968687	Chiral Separation and Determination of Multiple Organophosphorus Pesticide Enantiomers in Soil Based on Cellulose-Based Chiral Column by LC-MS/MS.	The widespread use of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) has raised significant environmental and health concerns due to their residues in soil and potential entry into the food chain. This study introduced chiral analysis methods for four OPs-methamidophos (METHP), dipterex (DIP), malathion (MALA), and isothiophos-methyl (ISOME)-using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with cellulose-based chiral columns. Three distinct methods were established: one for METHP, another for DIP, and a third for MALA and ISOME. Key chromatographic variables, including organic mobile phases and column temperatures, were systematically optimized, achieving maximum resolutions (Rs) of 1.61 for METHP, 2.40 for DIP, 1.70 for MALA, and 2.02 for ISOME. The QuEChERS method was employed for sample pretreatment, ensuring high recoveries. All three methods demonstrated excellent linearity (R > 0.998), accuracy with recoveries ranging from 79% to 121%, precision with RSD% < 11%, and sensitivity with low limits of enantiomer detection (LODs) as low as 0.17 µg/kg for METHP, 0.087 µg/kg for DIP, 0.062 µg/kg for MALA, and 0.054 µg/kg for ISOME, representing a sensitivity improvement of 16-172 times compared to existing methods. Field soil samples from Yangzizhou District, Nanchang, China, revealed significant contamination by ISOME, with concentrations of a single enantiomer reaching up to 8343 µg/kg, while MALA exhibited varying enantiomeric ratios with depth. This study provides robust analytical tools for monitoring chiral OP residues in soil, contributing to food safety and environmental protection.
39968372	Molecular characterization, chemical profile and biological properties of essential oils from <i>Chamaemelum nobile</i> (L.) flowers of Morocco: in vitro and <i>in silico</i> studies.	This study investigated the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and insecticidal properties of <i>Chamaemelum nobile</i> (L.) essential oil (CN-EO), harvested in Taounate, Morocco. The molecular composition and chemical profile of CN-EO were also characterized.
39968127	Optimizing the thermostability of triketone dioxygenase for engineering tolerance to mesotrione herbicide in soybean and cotton.	Optimized triketone dioxygenase (TDO) variants with enhanced temperature stability parameters were engineered to enable robust triketone tolerance in transgenic cotton and soybean crops. This herbicide tolerance trait, which can metabolize triketone herbicides such as mesotrione and tembotrione, could be useful for weed management systems and provide additional tools for farmers to control weeds. TDO has a low melting point (~39°C-40°C). We designed an optimization scheme using a hypothesis-based rational design to improve the temperature stability of TDO. Temperature stabilization resulted in enzymes with K<sub>cat</sub> values less than half of wild-type TDO. The best variant TDO had a K<sub>cat</sub> of 1.2 min<sup>-1</sup> compared to wild-type TDO, which had a K<sub>cat</sub> of 2.7 min<sup>-1</sup>. However K<sub>m</sub> values did not change much due to temperature stabilization. Recovery of the K<sub>cat</sub> without losing heat stability was the focus of additional optimization. Multiple variants were found that had better heat stability <i>in vitro</i> and efficacies against mesotrione equaling the wild-type (WT) TDO in greenhouse and field tests.
39967893	Quantitative NMR for detection of spinosad residues in agricultural soils.	Monitoring pesticide residues in soil is crucial for ensuring food safety and environmental sustainability. Spinosad, widely used in sustainable agriculture due to its selective toxicity and reduced environmental impact, poses detection challenges with traditional chromatographic methods, which require extensive sample preparation and are destructive. This study evaluates quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) as a non-destructive, efficient method for spinosad quantification in soil samples, emphasizing its potential for routine environmental monitoring. The qNMR method was validated with an 88% recovery rate for spinosad in agricultural soils, a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0414 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.1254 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The method exhibited linearity across a 2-8 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> concentration range (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.9928) and high precision, with coefficients of variation below 1% for both intraday and interday analyses. It was adaptable to diverse soil types, achieving consistent quantification in red loamy soil from Veracruz and black organic soil from Querétaro, Mexico. These results establish qNMR as a reliable, cost-effective alternative to chromatographic methods for spinosad residue analysis in soil, supporting routine environmental monitoring and regulatory compliance in sustainable agriculture.
39967818	Identification and management of a novel Danshen leaf anthracnose caused by <i>Colletotrichum karstii</i> in <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge in China.	Danshen (<i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> Bunge), a member of the genus <i>Salvia</i> within the <i>Lamiaceae</i> family, holds significant economic and medicinal value. Regrettably, the emergence of a novel leaf anthracnose in 2020 has significantly impacted its cultivation, leading to decreased yield and compromised quality. This newly identified pathogen was meticulously isolated from affected leaves, employing meticulous single conidia isolation techniques. Subsequent confirmation of pathogenicity was achieved through strict adherence of Koch's postulates. To ensure precise identification, morphological characteristics were supplemented with tandem sequence analysis targeting the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (<i>ITS</i>), β-tubulin (<i>TUB</i>), and histone (<i>His3</i>) regions. Combining molecular biology techniques with morphological observation and Koch's postulates, the pathogen was conclusively identified as <i>Colletotrichum karstii</i>. Further investigations focused on understanding the environmental factors influencing the mycelial growth and sporulation of the pathogen. The optimum temperature for the growth of <i>C.karstii</i> is 25°C, the suitable light conditions are 12h light/12h dark or 24h dark, and the suitable pH is 5 to 9. Utilizing BIOLOG phenotypic analysis technique, the metabolic utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources by the pathogen was assessed across different temperatures (20°C, 25°C, and 30°C). Results indicated the highest utilization rates at 25°C, particularly for arbutin and L-tryptophan. Lastly, the efficacy of 15 chemical fungicides and six botanical fungiticide against <i>C. karstii</i> was evaluated in vitro, revealing fluazinam as the most potent inhibitor against mycelial growth with <i>EC<sub>50</sub></i> of 0.0725 mg/mL for mycelium and 0.0378 mg/mL for spore germination, respectively. The 1 % osthole emulsion in water was found to have the strongest inhibitory effect on the growth of mycelium, with an EC50 value of 4.8984 µg/mL. Spore germination was most strongly inhibited by the 80 % ethylicin EC, which had an EC50 value of 0.5541 µg/mL. This study represents the first documentation of <i>C. karstii</i> as a causative agent of anthrax in Danshen, underscoring the significance of these findings for agricultural management and disease control strategies.
39967817	Tetramycin ameliorates tebuconazole·azoxystrobin to control leaf spot and viral diseases of Taizishen.	Leaf spot and viral diseases are the most frequently occurring leaf problems in Taizishen production. In this study, we examined the controlling role played by the co-application of tetramycin and low dose tebuconazole·azoxystrobin against leaf spot and viral diseases in Taizishen, investigating its resistance, electrophysiological information, growth and quality. Among them, electrophysiological information indicators include electrical signals [intrinsic capacitance (IC), resistance (IR), impedance (IZ), capacitive reactance (IXc), and inductive reactance (IXL)], intracellular water metabolism, nutrient transport, and plant metabolic activity. The results indicate that 0.3% tetramycin 1000-time + 75% tebuconazole·azoxystrobin 2000-time diluent controlled leaf spot and viral diseases the best, with protection effects of 90.03%~90.46% and 71.67%~73.08% at 15~30 days after the last fungicide application, respectively. These values are obviously higher than those treated with high doses of tetramycin or tebuconazole·azoxystrobin alone. Concurrently, their combined application could notably enhance total soluble flavonoids, total soluble phenols, protective enzyme activity, IC, intracellular water metabolism, nutrient transport, and metabolic activity, while reducing its MDA, IR, IZ, IXc, and IXL. Moreover, their co-application also could obviously ameliorate photosynthesis, biomass, agronomic trait, and root growth and quality, as well as actually reduce tebuconazole·azoxystrobin input. Additionally, the control effects of leaf spot and viral diseases in Taizishen treated by their combined application exhibited significant correlations with its disease resistance, electrophysiology, photosynthesis, growth, and quality parameters. This study highlights the combined application of low-dosage tebuconazole·azoxystrobin and tetramycin as a practicable measure for controlling leaf spot and viral diseases in Taizishen, promoting its resistance, growth, and quality, as well as reducing chemical pesticide application.
39967816	Herbicide resistance in <i>Leptochloa chinensis</i> (L.) Nees populations from different regions of Jiangsu Province, China: sensitivity differences and underlying mechanisms.	<i>Leptochloa chinensis</i> (L.) Nees, a noxious weed species commonly found in rice fields, has become a significant challenge in Jiangsu Province, China, as it has developed resistance to multiple herbicides due to extensive and continuous herbicide use in recent years. Therefore, this study was conducted to elucidate sensitivity differences and the mechanisms underlying the resistance of <i>L. chinensis</i> (L.) Nees populations to commonly used herbicides across different regions of Jiangsu Province, China. A whole-plant bioassay was used to assess the sensitivity of 46 <i>L. chinensis</i> populations collected from various areas within Jiangsu to several herbicides frequently applied in paddy fields, including: cyhalofop-butyl, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, pyraclonil, benzobicyclon, anilofos, and oxaziclomefone. After treatment with cyhalofop-butyl, 38 out of 46 populations showed relative resistance-index values that were over four times that of the controls, indicating significant resistance to cyhalofop-butyl. All 41 cyhalofop-butyl-resistant populations showed cross-resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl but remained susceptible to pyraclonil, benzobicyclon, anilofos, and oxaziclomefone. The proportion of populations resistant to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibiting herbicides increased progressively from the south to the north of Jiangsu. Cross-resistance was evident between cyhalofop-butyl and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl; however, all resistant populations were susceptible to pyraclonil, benzobicyclon, anilofos, and oxaziclomefone. Furthermore, mutations in the <i>ACCase</i> gene were identified as a crucial mechanism for cyhalofop-butyl resistance. Specifically, we found <i>ACCase</i> mutations I1781L, W1999C, W2027C/L/S, I2041N, and D2078G in cyhalofop-butyl-resistant <i>L. chinensis</i> populations, among which, W1999C and W2027C accounted for a relatively high proportion, while I1781L, W2027L/S, I2041N, and D2078G were found in one population each. <i>ACCase</i> gene mutations are seemingly a key mechanism for the development of resistance to cyhalofop-butyl, thus, our study provides useful information for developing effective weed-management strategies for controlling this noxious weed species, while ensuring sustainable agricultural practices.
39967184	Photocatalytic degradation of the pesticide pyridaben: Identification of degradation pathways using SERS and GC-MS.	Degradation pathways of the pesticide pyridaben in tea caused by ultraviolet photocatalytic degradation were identified using SERS and GC-MS. Pyridaben in tea decreased from 4.50 mg/kg to 3.46 mg/kg after 2 h and to 0.62 mg/kg after 5 h, with a degradation rate of 86.22 % and a recovery rate of 90.00 %. The pyridaben degradation process involved C-S cleavage, with a SERS band of ν(C-S) at 710 cm<sup>-1</sup> disappearing in the first hour. This was followed by cleavage of the N atom and the attached tert butyl group, resulting in the cleavage of the C-N bond in the ring, causing ring opening degradation. The presence of residual pyridaben was not necessarily related to the content of tea polyphenols; however, the UV light significantly reduced the content of theobromine, EGC, EC, and ECG but increased the content of EGCG. Ultraviolet irradiation slightly reduced the moisture content of oolong tea samples and did not significantly affect the total ash content. The content of water extract increaseing irradiation time due to the influence of moisture. UV irradiation time at the range of 60-360 min could degrade pyridaben while reducing its impact on tea quality.
39967135	Optimized methods for the investigation of changes in levels of pesticide residues and their transformation products in iceberg lettuce.	Iceberg lettuce is one of the most consumed leafy vegetables, which is often treated by different pesticides against pests and diseases. The aim of this study was to describe the fate of 25 pesticides (16 fungicides, 7 insecticides and 2 herbicides) based on quantitative analysis of the parent compounds and targeted screening of their (bio)transformation products. Mathematical models describing a decrease in pesticide residue levels were proposed for 24 pesticides using a first-order kinetic equation. These models provide the data needed to predict consumer exposure associated with the consumption of conventionally grown iceberg lettuce. At harvest, concentrations of most pesticides were dropped under the established EU maximum residue levels, except for flonicamid, fluazifop and pyriproxyfen. A total of 113 pesticide metabolites and degradation products were detected and tentatively identified in extracts prepared by an optimized extraction procedure, i.e., the acidified QuEChERS method. Several products of reactions such as hydrolysis, dealkylation, dehalogenation and/or oxidation-reduction, originated either from various physicochemical processes, or within Phase I pesticide metabolism were detected. Additionally, numerous conjugates with hexose, malonic acid or acetic acid formed during PhaseII of pesticide metabolism were found. In this way, a deeper understanding of specific pesticide degradation mechanisms is facilitated. In addition, it is easier to track the history of pesticide treatment.
39967094	Fatty acid esters of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol and glycidol in palm oil: A review on current industrial-scale mitigation strategies, challenges and perspectives.	Glycidyl ester (GE) and 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol ester (3-MCPDE) are food contaminants formed during edible oil refining. Due to their potential human carcinogenicity, the European Commission has established regulatory limits for vegetable oil, including palm oil. While laboratory-scale studies have shown promising reductions, large-scale implementation remains challenging. This review examines current mitigation technologies for palm oil, evaluated from lab to plant scale, and explores the challenges of large-scale implementation. Effective methods, such as crude palm oil washing, bleaching with non-hydrochloric acid-activated bleaching earth, dual-temperature deodorisation, and double refining, have been successfully tested at pilot scale or larger. Particularly, crude palm oil washing is widely adopted to reduce 3-MCPDE, whereas double refining effectively targets GE. However, a combination of strategies is required to simultaneously reduce 3-MCPDE and GE. These measures often lead to increased costs, oil loss and wastewater generation, with potential impacts on product quality. Furthermore, maintaining crude palm oil quality through good harvesting and milling practices is essential for consistent mitigation results. Continued research is necessary to improve mitigation methods for greater cost efficiency and reduced environmental impact, with large-scale studies needed to validate lab-scale findings and facilitate industry adoption.
39966953	The impact of insecticide decay on the rate of insecticide resistance evolution for monotherapies and mixtures.	The problem of insecticide decay following their deployment in public health applications is frequently highlighted as an issue for sustained disease control. There are additional concerns that it also increases selection for insecticide resistance. Despite these concerns insecticide decay is largely absent from models evaluating insecticide resistance management strategies.
39966927	Mosquito mutations F290V and F331W expressed in acetylcholinesterase of the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli): biochemical properties and inhibitor sensitivity.	The Old World sand fly, Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli), a vector of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, is usually controlled by insecticides, including anticholinesterases. Previous studies have revealed 85% amino acid sequence identity of recombinant P. papatasi acetylcholinesterase (rPpAChE1) to mosquito AChE. They identified synthetic carbamates that selectively inhibited rPpAChE1 and circumvented the G119S mutation responsible for high-level resistance to anticholinesterases. This study reports the construction, baculovirus expression, and biochemical properties of rPpAChE1 containing the F290V and F331W orthologous mutations from mosquitoes.
39966497	Sustainable pest management using plant secondary metabolites regulated azadirachtin nano-assemblies.	Biopesticides have emerged as a global trend to minimize the risks associated with synthetic agrochemicals. However, their stability and efficacies remain challenges for widespread application. Herein, co-assembled nanoparticles (AT NPs or AP NPs) based on azadirachtin (AZA) and tannic acid (TA) or phenylalanine (PA) are constructed in aqueous solution through self-assembly technology. The small particle size, low PDI, high ζ-potential, and related other physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles can improve wettability, adhesiveness, rain erosion resistance, and photostability compared to the commercial AZA formulation. Importantly, co-assemblies with bidirectional pH-responsive disassembly in acidic or alkaline solutions, allow them to respond to microenvironmental stimuli of targets and enable controlled release of AZA. The nanosystems demonstrated remarkable in vitro and in vivo insecticidal activities against Ostrinia furnacalis and Aphis gossypii. This study illustrates a distinctive perspective for developing eco-friendly nanosystems, highlighting a water-based treatment method for biopesticides with improved physicochemical properties and utilization efficiency.
39966467	A sensitive chalcogenide-based electrochemical sensor for ultra-level detection of Mospilan residues in real samples.	Addressed herein, the synthetic bismuthinite and bismuthinite@copper sulphide as two metal chalcogenides have been applied for modifying a glassy carbon electrode(GCE). The as-prepared nanomaterials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDX). By comparing the results, bismuthinite @copper sulphide hybridized with graphene oxide (GO) modified electrode exhibited superior sensitivity for detection ultra-levels of pesticide Mospilan (acetamiprid) in real samples. The dynamic concentration range of acetamiprid was found to be 80-680nM with a remarkably low detection limit about 4.1nM along with good stability and repeatability. Finally, the fabricated electrochemical sensor, bismuthinite@copper sulphide/GO, was suggested as a suitable alternative to more complex enzyme-based and aptamer-based methods for Mospilan detection.
39966322	Biochar-based electrochemical sensors: a tailored approach to environmental monitoring.	Biochar (BC), often obtained via thermochemical conversion methods of biomass, has emerged as a versatile material with significant potential in electrochemical sensing applications. This review critically examines the recent advancements in the development of BC-based sensors for the electrochemical determination of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, heavy metals, phenolic compounds, and microplastics. BC-based electrochemical sensors have emerged as a promising alternative due to their sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and excellent electrochemical properties. The unique physicochemical properties of BC, including its high surface area, porosity, and functional groups, contribute to its effectiveness as a sensor material. The review begins with an overview of the synthesis methods for BC, highlighting the activation strategies on its structural and electrochemical properties. Next, the functionalization of BC and its integration into electrochemical sensor platforms are explored. The performance of BC-based sensors is evaluated using electrochemical focusing on their sensitivity, selectivity, detection limits, and stability. Future directions for research are proposed, emphasizing the need for further optimization, miniaturization, and integration of BC-based sensors into portable and on-site analytical devices.
39966255	Discovery of highly effective antiviral agents based on flavonoid-benzothiazole against TMV.	A series of flavonol derivatives containing benzothiazole were designed and synthesized. The structures of all the compounds were characterized by NMR and HRMS. The results of the activity assay showed that some of the target compounds possessed outstanding in vivo antiviral activity against the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Among them, the median effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of L20 was 90.5 and 202.2 μg/mL for curative and protective activity against TMV, respectively, which was better than that of ningnanmycin (NNM: 252.0 and 204.2 μg/mL). The results of microcalorimetric thermophoresis (MST) and molecular docking experiments indicate that L20 binds TMV-CP more strongly than NNM; density functional theory (DFT) calculation the indicating that L20 is more chemical reactivity than NNM. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase assay (SOD) activity measurements also fully confirmed that L20 stimulated the plant immune system and strengthened the plant's resistance to diseases by lowering the MDA content and increasing the SOD activity. Furthermore, the chlorophyll content test experiment found that L20 could reduce the destructive effect of viruses on chloroplasts, increase the content of chlorophyll, and promote photosynthesis. In conclusion, above experimental results suggested that flavonol derivatives containing benzothiazole could be further investigated as new plant virus antiviral drugs.
39966088	Different nontarget-site mechanisms underlie resistance to dicamba and 2,4-D in an Amaranthus tuberculatus population.	Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.) Sauer (waterhemp) has emerged as one of several weed species that is resistant to synthetic auxin herbicides (SAHs). Among the mechanisms of resistance to SAHs, nontarget-site resistance (NTSR) has been of particular concern owing to its complexity. Here, we integrated linkage mapping with transcriptome analysis to explore NTSR mechanisms to two SAHs, dicamba and 2,4-D, in a multiple-herbicide-resistant A. tuberculatus population (CHR).
39965772	Conserved and Antenna-Biased Odorant Receptor in the Rape Stem Weevil <i>Ceutorhynchus asper</i> Tuned to Green Leaf Volatiles from Hosts.	The rape stem weevil, <i>Ceutorhynchus asper</i> Roel. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a severe pest of oilseed rape. Currently, little is known about the chemosensory functions of odorant receptors (ORs) in coleopterans such as <i>C. asper</i>. Here, the antennal and body transcriptomes of adult <i>C. asper</i> were sequenced and annotated. In total, 49 ORs were identified in <i>C. asper</i>, and transcriptome and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses showed that <i>CaspOR5</i> was antenna-biased. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that homologs of CaspOR5 were conserved among coleopterans. In single sensillum recordings of transgenic flies, CaspOR5 was found to be narrowly tuned to six green leaf volatiles (GLVs) of oilseed rape. Molecular docking indicated that active sites of CaspOR5 bound to GLVs were highly conserved. (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenol, 1-hexanol, and (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenol were attractive for both sexes of <i>C. asper</i>, and (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenal was only attractive to male weevils. In conclusion, CaspOR5 can facilitate perception of GLVs, thereby playing crucial roles in host plant search and location of <i>C. asper</i>. Our investigation provides insights into the olfactory functions of the conserved CaspOR5 in Coleoptera and can facilitate future research on developing novel green strategies in management of related pest weevils.
39965739	Eucalyptol attenuates indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers in rats by modulating the ICAM-1, eNOS and COX/LOX pathways: Insights from in silico, in vitro and in vivo approaches.	In order to evaluate anti-inflammatory role of eucalyptol (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg orally), inflammation was induced in rats using 0.1 ml of histamine and 0.1 ml of formaldehyde. Furthermore, in vivo gastroprotective potential of eucalyptol (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) was determined via the intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg indomethacin as an ulcerative agent and omeprazole (30 mg/kg) orally as a standard. Estimation of biochemical (PGE<sub>2,</sub> ICAM-1, COX-I, COX-II, eNOS and 5-LOX) and oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, GSH, and MDA) markers were carried out in gastric tissues using ELISA. The morphological and histopathological features of the gastric tissues were studied. In vitro, eucalyptol stabilized red blood cell membranes and inhibited protein denaturation, with the maximum effect observed at a concentration of 6400 μg/mL. Eucalyptol significantly reduced rat paw edema in histamine- and formaldehyde-induced inflammation models. It increased gastric PGE<sub>2,</sub> COX-I and eNOS levels, and decreased COX-II, 5-LOX and ICAM-1. Eucalyptol reduced ulcer indices and improved histopathological changes. Eucalyptol also increased antioxidants levels with decreased MDA levels in isolated rat stomach tissues. Therefore, eucalyptol shows gastroprotective effects against histamine- and formaldehyde induced inflammation and indomethacin-induced gastric ulcers through the modulation of the COX/LOX, ICAM-1, eNOS pathways and oxidative stress biomarkers.
39965711	A bacterial platform for the production of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and its derivatives.	4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPAA) and its derivatives, such as homoprotocatechuic acid (3,4-DHBA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and homoisovanillic acid (IHVA), are valuable phenolic acids that exhibit antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. They have diverse uses in pharmaceutical, pesticide, and cosmetic industries. Despite their significant importance, microbial production of these chemicals faces challenges such as limited titer or the incomplete understanding of their biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms. In this work, we developed a platform Escherichia coli strain that capable of efficiently producing 4-HPAA by systematical engineering of its biosynthetic pathway. The best engineered strain produced 31.95 g/L of 4-HPAA with a carbon yield of 0.27 g/g glucose, which is the highest titer reported so far. Then, this microbial platform was extended to biosynthesize 3,4-DHBA, HVA and IHVA, by screening hydroxylases and methyltransferases. This led to the de novo production of 3.15 g/L 3,4-DHBA, 102.36 mg/L HVA and 356.74 mg/L IHVA. This work establishes an efficient chassis for producing 4-HPAA and provides a microbial platform for generating its derivatives.
39965394	Identification of potent phytochemicals against Magnaporthe oryzae through machine learning aided-virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation approach.	Magnaporthe oryzae stands as a notorious fungal pathogen responsible for causing devastating blast disease in cereals, leading to substantial reductions in grain production. Despite the usage of chemical fungicides to combat the pathogen, their effectiveness remains limited in controlling blast disease. Consequently, there exists a pressing need to discover a novel natural biofungicide for efficient blast disease management. To address this challenge, we combined machine learning-based bioactivity prediction with virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the molecular interactions between forty-eight plant-derived natural compounds and the effector protein, Avr-PikE, an avirulence protein from Magnaporthe oryzae. Among the evaluated phytochemicals, Calotropin, Lupeol, and Azadirachtin emerged as the top-ranking molecules based on their favourable affinity through molecular docking with the effector. MD simulations for 100 ns were conducted to ascertain the stability and reliability of these compounds. Through classical and steered MD simulations and free energy calculations, it was revealed that these selected compounds exhibit stable and favourable energies, thereby establishing strong binding interactions with Avr-PikE. These screened natural metabolites were also found to meet crucial criteria for fungicide-likeness. To support accessibility and broader applications, we also developed a bioactivity prediction app (http://login1.cabgrid.res.in:5260/), allowing users to predict bioactivity against fungi based on our model. The efficacy of one potent compound, Lupeol, was validated through in vitro experiments, confirming its significant antifungal activity against Magnaporthe oryzae. Such biofungicides hold promise for enhancing disease management strategies and mitigating the impact of blast disease on cereal crops.
39965375	Competition moderates impact of anthelmintic-contaminated soil on growth and fitness of temperate grassland species.	In animal husbandry, the macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic moxidectin is commonly used and may accumulate in pasture soils, potentially impacting plant growth and fitness. To investigate these effects while considering plant competition, we conducted a completely randomised pot experiment. We grew four temperate grassland species - Achillea ptarmica, Agrostis capillaris, Dianthus deltoides, and Plantago lanceolata - separately in pots, with soil treated with formulated moxidectin at three concentration levels (0.1, 1, 5 μg g<sup>-1</sup>) or left untreated (control). In half of the pots, we added the dominant grass species Poa pratensis as a competitor. Over a full growth period in a greenhouse, we measured three morphological traits: above-ground plant biomass (APB), specific leaf area (SLA), and intact leaf area (ILA). Moxidectin concentrations in the above-ground plant parts and soil were analysed using HPLC. Results showed that moxidectin was absorbed by the roots and transported to the above-ground plant parts. At the highest concentration (5 μg g<sup>-1</sup>), APB and ILA were reduced by 14.4 % and 19.8 %, respectively, compared to controls, while SLA increased by 12.2 %. Anthelmintic effects varied with competition; for APB, significant effects were noted only in the absence of competition for three out of four species. The highest increases in SLA and reductions in ILA at 5 μg g<sup>-1</sup> occurred without competition in one and three species, respectively. These findings suggest that soil contamination by anthelmintic residues can negatively affect the growth and fitness of grassland plants, particularly in low-competition areas, such as open soil patches, which serve as protective microsites for plant recruitment.
39965371	Effects of the insecticide flupyradifurone and the fungicides pyraclostrobin and fluxapyroxad on behavior and morphophysiology in Melipona scutellaris.	Native stingless bees are important for natural ecosystems and human nutrition. However, they may be exposed to pesticides used in agriculture. Pesticides are sold as commercial formulations, either with a single active ingredient (e.g., flupyradifurone insecticide) or multiple ones (e.g., pyraclostrobin and fluxapyroxad fungicide). Considering the impact of pesticides on non-target organisms, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of these isolated and combined formulated products on the survival, behavior, and morphophysiology of the midgut and Malpighian tubules of Melipona scutellaris foragers. Sampled bees were divided into the following experimental groups: insecticide (6 ng/μL of flupyradifurone), fungicide (0.1 ng/μL of pyraclostrobin and 0.05 ng/μL of fluxapyroxad), and a combination of both solutions (flupyradifurone: 3 ng/μL, pyraclostrobin: 0.05 ng/μL, and fluxapyroxad: 0.025 ng/μL). Individuals were chronically exposed to pesticides orally to record the survival probability. According to the result, a new bioassay was performed to evaluate their behavior and organ lesion indexes. Exposed bees exhibited high mortality compared to the control experimental group. The insecticide group showed significant alterations in mobility over the course of the experiment, and all experimental groups demonstrated impaired behavior. Histological images also revealed the presence of three levels of injury in the midgut (cell elimination, apocrine secretion, spherocrystals, vacuolization and pycnotic nuclei) and Malpighian tubules (spherocrystals, vacuolization and pycnotic nuclei) following a brief exposure period. The data demonstrate that, even in the short term, both formulated products impair the health and survival of the species, disrupting the internal dynamics of the colony and consequently lead to its weakening.
39965336	Visual immunosensor assay with double T line for on-site sensitive fipronil pesticide detection in water, soil and honeysuckle.	Fipronil (FPN) is one of widely used pesticides in the fields of plants cultivation and animal husbandry, caused widespread pollution in multiple environmental media including water, soil, and plants, posing serious risks to ecological environment and human health. However, the complexity of environmental substrates and low pesticide content pose challenges for their detection. To overcome these challenges, the development of high specificity, convenient, and broad-applicability rapid detection methods is crucial. In this study, computer simulated semi-antigens and then novel FPN-immunogens were designed and synthesized by modifying carrier proteins to expose them to specific sites, so as to prepare monoclonal antibodies with high specificity and sensitivity to FPN. Afterwards, a sensitive and visual quantitative detection strip was developed based on a double T-linear AuNP-labeled immunosensor with a calculated limit of detection (cLOD) of 1.23 μg/kg in water, 6.46 μg/kg in soil and 13.7 μg/kg in honeysuckle, meanwhile the recoveries were in the range of 92.3∼108.5 %. Excellent stability and accuracy have been demonstrated by comparing the liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer methods. The proposed method can be widely applied for rapid screening and on-site quantitative analysis of FPN pesticide pollutants in various complex environmental scenarios.
39965280	Assessment of exposure to Phenanthrene: Insight in to the in vivo, in vitro, and in silico techniques.	Organic pollutants have become a serious environmental concern due to improper use of agricultural chemicals, mining activities, and large volumes of urban waste discharge. Organic pollutants have emerged as a significant ecological issue because of the misuse of agricultural chemicals, mining operations, and the substantial discharge of urban waste. Phenanthrene (PHE), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), has various industrial applications such as dyes, plastics, pesticides, explosives, and drugs. In this study, to estimate the Human serum albumin (HAS) binding and liver cytotoxicity of PHE, the in vivo, in vitro, and in silico investigation was applied. The results show that the interaction between PHE and HSA can be done, spontaneously. The in vivo study demonstrated that both low- and high doses of PAH led to a decrease in hepatocytes and sinusoid volumes and an upward trend in blood vessels compared to the control group. The total measured biochemical factors except for HDL showed an increase in both doses of PAH compared to controls. The serum level of HDL in Phe-treated rats was markedly decreased compared to control rats.
39965112	Application of nDATA Workflow for Semi-Quantitative Screening of 1094 Pesticide Residues in Fruits and Vegetables Using UHPLC/ESI Q-Orbitrap Full MS/vDIA.	Cost-effective multi-residue pesticide methods with a broad detection scope are desired for risk-based monitoring programs.

39965030	Transcriptomic analysis reveals cloquintocet-mexyl-inducible genes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	Identification and characterization of genes encoding herbicide-detoxifying enzymes is lacking in allohexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Gene expression is frequently induced by herbicide safeners and implies the encoded enzymes serve a role in herbicide metabolism and detoxification. Cloquintocet-mexyl (CM) is a safener commonly utilized with halauxifen-methyl (HM), a synthetic auxin herbicide whose phytotoxic form is halauxifen acid (HA). Our first objective was to identify candidate HA-detoxifying genes via RNA-Seq by comparing untreated and CM-treated leaf tissue. On average, 81% of RNA-Seq library reads mapped uniquely to the reference genome and 76.4% of reads were mapped to a gene. Among the 103 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs), functional annotations indicate the majority of DEGs encode proteins associated with herbicide or xenobiotic metabolism. This finding was further corroborated by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, where several genes were assigned GO terms indicating oxidoreductase activity (34 genes) and transferase activity (45 genes). One of the significant DEGs is a member of the CYP81A subfamily of cytochrome P450s (CYPs; denoted as CYP81A-5A), which are of interest due to their ability to catalyze synthetic auxin detoxification. To investigate CYP expression induced by HM and/or CM, our second objective was to measure gene-specific expression of CYP81A-5A and its homoeologs (CYP81A-5B and CYP81A-5D) in untreated leaf tissue and leaf tissue treated with CM and HM over time using RT-qPCR. Relative to the reference gene (β-tubulin), basal CYP expression is high, expression among these CYPs varies over time, and expression for all CYPs is CM-inducible but not HM-inducible. Further analysis of CYP81A-5A, such as gene knock-out, overexpression experiments, or in vitro activity assays with purified enzyme are necessary to test the hypotheses that the encoded CYP detoxifies HA and that CM upregulates this reaction.

One of the main risk factors of COVID-19 is Pulmonary fibrosis (PF). The protective effect of Jingfang Granule (JF) to bleomycin-induced PF has been confirmed in our previous studies. This work was designed to reveal the effect and mechanism of JF on PF which induced by Paraquat (PQ).
39964989	Coverage and contextual factors associated with insecticide-treated net use among women of reproductive age in Nigeria: evidence from the 2021 malaria indicator survey data.	Nigeria continues to face a serious public health problem due to malaria, which contributes around 27% of all cases worldwide. Although insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are essential interventions for preventing malaria, their use in Nigeria is still sub-optimal. Understanding the factors influencing ITN use is essential to improve malaria control strategies. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of and factors associated with ITN use among women of reproductive age in Nigeria. We conducted a secondary data analysis of the 2021 Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS). The sample included 14,476 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) from 567 clusters across Nigeria's six geopolitical zones. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the contextual factors associated with ITN use, accounting for both fixed and random effects. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05, with 95% confidence intervals reported for all estimates. The weighted prevalence of ITN use was 41.5% (95% CI: 39.7, 43.3). The results showed Muslim women had 21% (aOR= 0.79; 95% CI: 0.67-0.94) lower odds of ITN use, when compared with the Christian women. Those who had living children were more likely to report ITN use, when compared with women with no child. The non-poor women had higher odds of ITN use, when compared with the poor women (aOR= 1.35; 95% CI: 1.19-1.52). In addition, women from multi-ethnic had 26% lower odds of ITN use, when compared with those from mono-ethnic community (aOR= 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57-0.94). The geographical region was significantly associated with ITN use among Nigerian women. Those from high-level community poverty had 53% reduction in the odds of ITN use, when compared with women from low-level community poverty (aOR= 0.47; 95% CI: 0.32-0.68). ITN use among women of reproductive age in Nigeria remained below the national target. Interventions to increase ITN use should consider the complex interplay of individual and community-level factors. Targeted strategies addressing socioeconomic disparities, leveraging cultural contexts, and implementing community-based approaches are crucial for improving ITN utilization and reducing the malarial burden in Nigeria.
39964794	First Report of Purple Seed Stain Caused by <i>Cercospora cf. flagellaris</i> on Soybean in Korea.	In November 2021 and 2022, soybean seeds exhibiting purple staining were collected from Suwon, Gimje, and Yeoncheon in Korea. The symptoms first appeared on aging leaves and eventually covered the entire leaf. Initial infection manifested as small yellow spots that turned light brown or white, accompanied by yellow halos, with visible clusters of conidia at the center. The seeds showed shallow purple discoloration on the seed coat and deep purple staining within the seed. Infected leaves were surface sterilized with 10% chlorine solution and cultured on general isolation media. Colonies appeared white to gray after incubation in a growth chamber at 25°C with a 12-hour photoperiod. Single-spore isolates were transferred to PDA with 6% sucrose, showing a color change to brown or dark shades. Three isolates were selected for identification and pathogenicity tests. Conidiophores were brown, straight or slightly curved, and uniformly wide, forming clusters of 5-12 on the leaf's lower surface, measuring 300-700 μm (average = 560 μm, n = 25). Conidia were hyaline, needle-shaped, straight or slightly curved, and tapered at the base, with 3-15 indistinct septa, measuring 60-240 μm (average = 180 μm, n = 25). DNA was extracted from the three isolates, and sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2, actin (ACT), HIS3, and calmodulin (CAL) were obtained. These sequences were deposited in GenBank (PQ578698, PQ583605, PQ583606, PQ583607 and PQ583608). BLAST search results revealed 99-100% identity with Cercospora flagellaris for ITS and ACT sequences. To fulfill Koch's postulates, the isolates were grown in a growth chamber (25°C, 12-hour photoperiod) for 20 days. Spore suspensions (10^4 spores/ml) with 0.01% Tween 20 were sprayed on Nuriol and Jangol cultivars. Inoculated plants were maintained in a humid environment for 72 hours and then transferred to a greenhouse. Control plants were sprayed with sterilized water and kept under the same conditions. Five weeks post-inoculation, all inoculated plants exhibited purple seed stain symptoms, while control plants remained healthy. The same pathogen was re-isolated from the inoculated plants. Cercospora flagellaris is known to affect a wide range of plant species in various countries, including the USA and Brazil. This is the first report of C. flagellaris causing purple seed stain on soybean in Korea. Soybean is a critical food and oil crop in Korea. Therefore, further studies are needed to assess the epidemiology, cultivar responses, fungicide sensitivity, and management strategies to support the sustainability and future potential of soybean cultivation in Korea.
39964793	Evaluation of Fungicides for the Management of Glomerella Leaf Spot and Bitter Rot on Apple in North Carolina.	Glomerella leaf spot (GLS) and bitter rot caused by species in the <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i> species complex are the most economically devastating fungal diseases of apples in North Carolina. Crop losses have reached 100% in highly susceptible cultivars. In the southeastern United States, management of this disease has predominantly relied on broad-spectrum fungicide programs targeting several summer diseases of apples. To improve control of GLS and bitter rot, field experiments to evaluate the efficacy of multi- and single-site fungicides were conducted over multiple years in a 'Gala' research orchard located in Mills River, NC from 2017-2019. Fungicides representing different modes of action were applied in a non-rotational program from petal fall until the immediate pre-harvest period to assess their efficacy in reducing GLS incidence, shoot defoliation due to GLS, and pre-and post-harvest bitter rot. Of the fungicides evaluated, Captan 80WDG (a.i. captan), Merivon (a.i. fluxapyroxad and pyraclostrobin), Cabrio (a.i. pyraclostrobin), and Aprovia (a.i. benzovindiflupyr), provided good to excellent control against disease caused by Colletotrichum chrysophilum. In these programs, the incidence of GLS, expressed as relative area under the disease progress curve (rAUDPC), ranged from 4.6 to 43.8 in the Captan 80WDG (2019) and the Aprovia (2017) programs, respectively. The incidence of bitter rot at harvest in these programs from 2017-2019 ranged from 0.0% to 45.3% in the 2018 and 2017 Captan 80WDG programs, respectively. Conversely, the highest incidences of GLS and pre-harvest bitter rot were consistently observed in the Inspire (a.i. difenoconazole), Sercadis (a.i. fluxapyroxad) and untreated programs. Shoot defoliation due to GLS followed a similar trend across the evaluated fungicide programs. In addition to non-rotational fungicide programs, the effect of carrier water pH for applications of captan was evaluated for bitter rot control in Virginia and NC. No differences in captan efficacy were observed at either location. Results of this study will inform the development of new management programs for GLS and bitter rot in the southeastern United States and provide a foundation for the development of new season-long fungicide programs for apple disease management.

39964392	Design, Synthesis, Antibacterial Activity, and Antivirulence Factor of Novel 1,2,4-Thiadiazole Derivatives Containing an Amide Moiety.	To develop antibacterial agents with novel mechanisms of action, a series of novel 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives containing amide structures were designed and synthesized. The antibacterial activities of derivatives against <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzicola</i> (<i>Xoc</i>), <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv. <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>), and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>actinidiae</i> (<i>Psa</i>) were evaluated, and all derivatives were exhibited excellent antibacterial activities. Among them, compound <b>Z4</b> demonstrated significant antibacterial activities against <i>Xoo</i>, <i>Xoc</i>, and <i>Psa</i>, with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.32, 0.43, and 11.06 mg/L, respectively. Compound <b>Z4</b> exhibited a protective activity of 49.42% and a curative activity of 44.93% against rice bacterial leaf blight. In addition, compound <b>Z4</b> could inhibit pathogenic bacteria by inhibiting a variety of virulence factors (exopolysaccharides, biofilms, motility, and extracellular enzymes). Compound <b>Z4</b> stimulated the biochemical process of rice self-defense signaling by affecting cell transcription and translation and induced rice self-defense genes and controlled hypersensitivity reactions to resist pathogen infection.
39964252	Dual GLP-1 and GIP Agonist Tirzepatide Exerted Neuroprotective Action in a Parkinson's Disease Rat Model.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related progressive disorder that leads to dopaminergic loss and subsequent motor dysfunction. Current therapies mainly deal with symptomatic effects, and hence, therapies targeting progressive neurodegeneration need to developed. In this study, tirzepatide, a coagonist of glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, exhibited a neuroprotective effect in preliminary studies. This study aims to evaluate the effect of tirzepatide, in comparison with exendin-4, in a rat model of PD. The effect of tirzepatide (50 and 100 nmol/kg, s.c.) and exendin-4 (8 μg/kg, s.c.) on behavioral functions, oxidative markers, inflammatory markers, dopamine level, and alpha-synuclein expression were studied against a rotenone (2 mg/kg)-induced toxicity model in rats. Tirzepatide prevented rotenone-induced motor deficits. Additionally, it significantly inhibited the rotenone-induced increase in proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Furthermore, it upregulated striatal dopamine levels. It alleviated oxidative stress and alpha-synuclein aggregation. Both doses of tirzepatide exert neuroprotective effects in a PD rat model. Furthermore, the effect is dose-dependent, and a 100 nmol/kg dose of tirzepatide was found to be more effective.
39964236	Indium(III)-terpyridine complexes: synthesis, structures and remarkable antifungal and anticancer activities.	Complexes of non-radioactive indium(III) with 2,2';6',2''-terpyridine (tpy) ligands have been rarely explored despite the popularity of tpy as a strong chelating ligand backbone. Herein, three mononuclear indium(III) complexes (In-1, In-2 and In-3) of tpy and its 4'-Cl and 4'-pyridyl derivatives have been synthesized and structurally characterized. While the crystal structure of In-1 has been previously studied, In-2 and In-3 were isolated and characterized for the first time. Two different polymorphs of In-2 were observed by simply varying the concentration of the reactants. Molecules of In-3 were determined by X-ray crystallography and found to adopt the same mononuclear coordination mode as that found in In-1 and In-2, while the remaining 4'-pyridyl ring was uncoordinated. Bioactivity studies revealed that indium(III) complexes In-1, In-2, and In-3 were fungicidal against the human fungal pathogen, <i>Candida albicans</i>, and several other non-<i>albicans Candida</i> species. Moreover, cytotoxicity studies showed these compounds were remarkably antiproliferative against human breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB 468).
39964105	Discovery of Novel Quinazolinone-2-carbohydrazide Derivatives as Effective Succinate Dehydrogenase Inhibitors and Biosafety Assessment on Rice and Zebrafish.	To develop potent and safe antifungal agents in agriculture, a total of 48 novel quinazolinone-2-carbohydrazide derivatives were designed and synthesized based on the pharmacophore hybridization method. The bioassay results demonstrated that many compounds exhibited powerful and broad-spectrum inhibition activities <i>in vitro</i> against the tested fungi. For instance, compounds <b>E23</b> and <b>F23</b> possessed EC<sub>50</sub> (half-maximal effective concentration) values of 0.41 and 0.47 μg/mL against <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, comparable to that of the commercial fungicide Boscalid (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.49 μg/mL). Additionally, compound <b>E23</b> also demonstrated pronounced antifungal effects against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, <i>Alternaria solani</i>, and <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i> with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.27, 1.15, and 0.27 μg/mL, respectively. <i>In vivo</i> assays on rice plants revealed that this compound at 200 μg/mL exhibited nearly equipotent curative and protective effects against <i>R. solani</i>, as compared with the positive controls Boscalid and Carbendazim. Moreover, compound <b>E23</b> had an obvious inhibition activity against fungal succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) from <i>R. solani</i> with the half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 11.76 μM, and the interactions between compound <b>E23</b> and SDH enzyme were further confirmed by molecular docking studies. Furthermore, the presence of compound <b>E23</b> also triggered obvious morphological changes of fungal mycelia and increased the conductivity and permeability of fungal cell membranes. Interestingly, the built three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models showed that the electrostatic effect played a more important role in maintaining anti-<i>R. solani</i> effects of target compounds than other effects. Finally, the biosafety assessment of compound <b>E23</b> demonstrated its safety toward rice and zebrafish.
39964042	Evaluation of GS-omega/kappa-Hxtx-Hv1a and Bt toxins against Bt-resistant and -susceptible strains of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith).	Helicoverpa zea and Spodoptera frugiperda are destructive insect pests of cotton and corn. Both have evolved practical resistance to transgenic crops producing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins in the United States. GS-omega/kappa-Hxtx-Hv1a (ω/κ-Hv1a) is a novel biopesticide derived from spider venom with activity against lepidopteran pests. The efficacy of ω/κ-Hv1a is dependent on combining it with a facilitator product such as a Bt-based insecticide. However, it is unknown if ω/κ-Hv1a can be an alternative for the management of Bt resistance. In this study, we tested the effect of ω/κ-Hv1a alone or in the presence of Bt toxins against susceptible and resistant H. zea and S. frugiperda.
39963741	Multifaceted Therapeutic Impacts of Cucurbitacin B: Recent Evidences From Preclinical Studies.	The most prevalent and bioactive cucurbitacin is Cucurbitacin B (CuB, C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>46</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), which is a tetracyclic triterpene chiefly present in the Cucurbitaceae family. CuB has a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties namely antioxidant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, hypoglycaemic, insecticidal, and neuroprotective properties, owing to its ability to regulate several signaling pathways, including the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (JAK/STAT3), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2/antioxidant responsive element (Nrf2/ARE), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Hippo-Yes-associated protein (YAP), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase-2A/protein phosphatase-2A (CIP2A/PP2A), Wnt and Notch pathways. The present review highlights the medicinal attributes of Cucurbitacin B (CuB) with special emphasis on their signaling pathways to provide key evidence of its therapeutic utility in the near future.
39963497	Assessing the authenticity and purity of a commercial <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> bioinsecticide through whole genome sequencing and metagenomics approaches.	Biopesticides, biological agents for pest control in plants, are becoming increasingly prevalent in agricultural practices. However, no established methodology currently exists to assess their quality, and there are currently no publicly available authenticity and purity evaluations of commercial products. This lack of data may represent risks because of their widespread dispersal in the environment. We evaluated the potential of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and metagenomics approaches, including nanopore long-read sequencing, to verify both authenticity (i.e., the labeled strain) and biological purity (i.e., the absence of any undesired genetic material) of commercial <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> bioinsecticides. Four commercially available bioinsecticidal products containing <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> serovar <i>kurstaki</i> strain HD-1 were collected from the European market as a case study. Two sequencing approaches were employed: WGS of isolates and metagenomics sequencing of all genetic material in a product. To assess authenticity, isolate WGS data were compared against the publicly available reference genome of the expected strain. Antimicrobial resistance gene content, insecticidal gene content, and single nucleotide polymorphism differences were characterized to evaluate similarity to the reference genome. To assess purity, metagenomic sequencing data were analyzed using read classification and strain differentiation methods. Additionally, long- and short-read data were used to assess potential large-scale structural variations. Our results confirmed all investigated products to be authentic and pure. With the increasing usage of biopesticides, it is crucial to have adequate quality control methods. Our proposed approach could be adapted for other biopesticides, and similar products, providing a standardized and robust approach to contribute to biopesticide safety.
39963359	Advancements in genome editing tools for genetic studies and crop improvement.	The rapid increase in global population poses a significant challenge to food security, compounded by the adverse effects of climate change, which limit crop productivity through both biotic and abiotic stressors. Despite decades of progress in plant breeding and genetic engineering, the development of new crop varieties with desirable agronomic traits remains a time-consuming process. Traditional breeding methods often fall short of addressing the urgent need for improved crop varieties. Genome editing technologies, which enable precise modifications at specific genomic loci, have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing crop traits. These technologies, including RNA interference, Meganucleases, ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas systems, allow for the targeted insertion, deletion, or alteration of DNA fragments, facilitating improvements in traits such as herbicide and insect resistance, nutritional quality, and stress tolerance. Among these, CRISPR/Cas9 stands out for its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to reduce off-target effects, making it a valuable tool in both agricultural biotechnology and plant functional genomics. This review examines the functional mechanisms and applications of various genome editing technologies for crop improvement, highlighting their advantages and limitations. It also explores the ethical considerations associated with genome editing in agriculture and discusses the potential of these technologies to contribute to sustainable food production in the face of growing global challenges.
39963041	A Short-Read Amplicon Sequencing Protocol and Bioinformatic Pipeline for Ecological Surveillance of Dipteran Disease Vectors.	Vector control remains an important strategy worldwide to prevent human infection with pathogens transmitted by arthropods. Vector control strategies rely on accurate identification of vector taxa along with vector-specific biological indicators such as feeding ecology, infection prevalence and insecticide resistance. Multiple 'DNA barcoding' protocols have been published over the past several decades to support these applications, generally relying on informal manual approaches such as BLAST to assign taxonomic identity to the resulting sequences. We present a standardised informatic pipeline for analysis of DNA barcoding data from dipteran vectors, VecTreeID, that uses short-read amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) coupled with sequence similarity assessment (BLAST) and an evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA-ng) to achieve vector taxonomic identification, capture bionomic features (blood and plant meal sources), determine Plasmodium infection status (for anopheline mosquitoes) and detect target-site insecticide resistance mutations. The VecTreeID pipeline provides uncertainty in assignment through identifications at varying levels of taxonomic rank, a feature missing from many approaches to DNA barcoding, but important given gaps and labelling problems in public sequence databases. We validated an Illumina-based implementation of VecTreeID on laboratory and field samples, and find that the blood meal amplicons can detect vertebrate DNA sequences up to 36 h post-feeding, and that short-read sequencing data are capable of sensitively detecting minor sequences in DNA mixtures representing multi-species blood or nectar meals. This high-throughput VecTreeID approach empowers researchers and public health professionals to survey and control arthropod disease vectors consistently and effectively.
39962982	Preconcentration-enhanced electrochemical detection of paraoxon in food and environmental samples using reduced graphene oxide-modified disposable sensors.	Organophosphates, such as paraoxon, are widely used as insecticides in agriculture, making their detection in environmental and food samples crucial due to their high toxicity. This study presents the development of an electrochemical sensor for the detection of paraoxon, using a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified with electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The modification enhanced the sensor's electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance. A novel preconcentration approach, involving potential pulses at -1.0 and 0.0 V, was employed to improve the adsorption of paraoxon on the electrode surface. Detection was performed by square wave voltammetry, and under optimized conditions, the rGO-SPCE sensor exhibited a linear range from 1.0 to 30 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>, with detection and quantification limits of 0.26 and 0.86 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The sensor demonstrated excellent repeatability (RSD = 4.22%), reproducibility (RSD = 7.14%), and selectivity (RSD < 9.22%). The method was successfully applied to tap water, grape and apple juices, and canned corn water samples, achieving recoveries of approximately 98% at the lowest concentration (1.0 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>) with minimal matrix effects. This approach offers a simple, low-cost, and rapid method for paraoxon detection in water and food samples.
39962894	Imazethapyr-Induced Inhibition of Arabidopsis Root Growth Associated with Disrupting Auxin Signal to Alter Cell Wall Remodeling.	Imazethapyr, a widely used herbicide, exhibits a long persistence in soils and can cause injury to rotational crops. Here, we discovered that imazethapyr inhibits primary root elongation in Arabidopsis by inhibiting cell division and expansion rather than damaging the organization of root meristem. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis revealed that imazethapyr downregulated multiple genes related to cell wall loosening and modification, leading to increased cell wall thickness and inhibited cellular expansion in Arabidopsis roots. Furthermore, imazethapyr upregulated auxin biosynthesis and transport, resulting in enhanced auxin accumulation at root tips. Elevated auxin concentrations triggered apoplast alkalization and the inactivation of wall-loosening enzymes, further suppressing root growth. This research provides new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying imazethapyr phytotoxicity and offers potential strategies for developing crops that are better adapted to soils contaminated with imidazolinone herbicides.
39962687	[Identification of Priority Sources for Heavy Metals in Soils of Typical Coal Gangue Accumulation Areas Based on Source-specific Health Risk Assessment].	Heavy metals contained in coal gangue can be released into the surrounding environment through various pathways during long-term accumulation, posing potential threats to human health. To effectively control and mitigate the health risks of heavy metals in the soil of coal gangue accumulation areas, this study focused on the Panyi coal gangue accumulation area in Huainan. The study involved collecting soil samples to determine the concentrations of Cd, Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, and Pb and employed the positive matrix factorization model for quantitative analysis of the contributions from different pollution sources of soil heavy metals. This approach, coupled with the results of the source analysis and a health risk assessment model, evaluates the risks posed by specific sources and further identifies the spatial distribution characteristics of health risk contributions from these sources. The results showed that the average concentrations of soil heavy metals Cd and Zn were 4.65 and 2.16 times their background values, respectively, with the average values of other heavy metals all below background levels. Among them, Zn was the most influenced by human activities. Source analysis indicated that the sources of soil heavy metals in the study area were influenced by coal gangue accumulation pollution, traffic activity pollution, natural parent material soil formation, and agricultural activity pollution sources, with contribution rates of 27.5%, 16.4%, 30.4%, and 25.6%, respectively. The non-carcinogenic risk of soil heavy metals to children requires special attention. Based on the specific source-health risk assessment model analysis, agricultural activities contributed the most to the non-carcinogenic risk to children （59.3%）, identifying them as a priority source for control measures. Given the spatial distribution of health risks from various sources, recommendations include enhancing the resourceful use of coal gangue, collecting and treating leachate from coal gangue, and implementing environmental management strategies to reduce pesticide and fertilizer use.

The study also sought to identify potential solutions.
39962426	Revitalizing maize downy mildew management: harnessing new-generation fungicides and host plant resistance.	Maize Downy Mildew (MDM) is a devastating disease in the humid sub-tropical/tropical regions of Asia. In this study, the prevalence of MDM during the rainy Kharif seasons of south Karnataka state (India) ranged between 6.8% (2018) and 19.1% (2022). The research evaluated new fungicidal treatments and assessed the genetic tolerance of maize lines to develop robust management strategies that enhance maize productivity and stability.
39962365	Phenotypic yield-attributed traits, essential oil content and composition of Iranian Grammosciadium platycarpum (Apiaceae) populations: a rich source of (S)-(+)-linalool.	(S)-(+)-linalool is a non-cyclic oxygenated monoterpene which is very useful and widely used in the cosmetic industries, especially in the production of perfume and cologne. Thus, due to the high commercial value and high demand, the search for new plant sources rich in (S)-(+)-linalool in agricultural systems to develop the business of this compound is of great interest. This investigation focused on the diversity of phenotypic yield and phytochemical traits in Grammosciadium platycarpum populations collected from fourteen geographical regions in Iran. The goal was to identify the essential compounds and select the best populations for domestication, cultivation, and future breeding programs. The highest coefficient of variation was observed in the umbrellas per plant, plant length, internode length, leaf width, number of lateral branches, and essential oil yield (EOY). The shoot dry weight ranged from 27.15 to 41.56 (g/plant) and the fruit dry weight from 9.23 to 20.80 (g/plant) among different populations, which was observed in the QOR population. The fruit of the plant was employed to extract and determine the content plus constituents of the essential oil. The essential oil content (EOC) exhibited a extend from 0.81 to 1.63%. MAQ population indicated the maximum and OSH population revealed the minimum EOC. The highest EOY (0.228 g/plant) was observed in the MAQ population and the lowest (0.083 g/plant) was related to the MAR population. Based on GC-MS and GC analysis, 91.97 to 99.93% of the essential compounds of different populations of G. platycarpum were identified. According to the results, linalool (65.90-81.62%) and limonene (9.73-15.34%) were the main ingredients of the essential oil profile. Rutin, ferulic acid, and chlorogenic acid were detected as the major phenolic compounds using HPLC. The high diversity observed among different populations of G. platycarpum provides good potential for selecting the best populations and using them in domestication projects, cultivation, and breeding programs.
39961931	Sublethal pesticide exposure alters stress response, detoxification, and immunity gene expression in larvae of the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia (Apidae: Meliponini).	During foraging, stingless bees are at risk of pesticide contamination from treated field crops. Frieseomellita varia workers, for example, frequently visit pepper plants that are often treated with the herbicide clomazone (CLZ), the fungicide difenoconazole (DFZ), and the insecticide abamectin (ABM). These pesticides pose a threat not only to adult bees but also to larvae when the chemicals are brought back to the nest. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of sublethal concentrations of CLZ, DFZ, and ABM on the expression of stress marker proteins (HSP70AB and HSP83), detoxification enzymes (CYP9Q3, CYP6SA4, and CYTP450), and antimicrobial peptides (abaecin and defen-1) genes in F. varia larvae. First instar larvae were incubated for 48 h in ELISA plates, divided into five groups: Naive (control), acetone (acetone control), CLZ (0.014 ng a.i./µL), DFZ (0.0098 ng a.i./µL), and ABM (0.007 ng a.i./µL). After incubation, total RNA was extracted and analyzed by RT-qPCR to quantify transcript levels. While larval survival was unaffected, significant changes in gene expression patterns were observed. ABM exposure increased HSP70AB expression and decreased HSP83 expression. No changes in CYTP6SA4 expression were detected in bees exposed to any of the pesticides. DFZ suppressed CYP9Q3 expression, while ABM upregulated CYTP450 expression. Notably, the antimicrobial peptide gene abaecin was downregulated by all three compounds, whereas defen-1 expression increased in response to ABM. These findings suggest that sublethal concentrations of these pesticides can significantly alter the expression of genes associated with stress response, detoxification, and immunity in F. varia larvae. The disruption caused by herbicides and fungicides, alongside the known effects of insecticides, may impact bee physiology and colony homeostasis, with potentially unknown consequences for the survival of stingless bees in their natural environment.
39961775	Design and Syntheses of Proherbicides Targeting 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase.	4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD, EC 1.13.11.27) is regarded as a crucial target in the domain of herbicide discovery. Herein, we adopted the proherbicides concept, based on the initially discovered lead compound <b>II-aa</b>. Our group has designed four derivatives by incorporating alkyl, carbonyl ester, sulfonyl ester, and phosphate ester fragments. Although these derivatives did not exhibit very strong inhibitory activity against HPPD <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in vivo</i> studies demonstrated their efficacy in suppressing HPPD activity. This was demonstrated by a reduction in HPPD protein levels and the emergence of significant bleaching symptoms in treated plants. Among these derivatives, the acetyl (<b>III-ag</b>), cyclopropyl carbonyl (<b>III-ak</b>), and pyridine-sulfonyl (<b>III-bm</b>) substituted derivatives demonstrated herbicidal activity that surpassed that of <b>II-aa</b>, exhibiting complete control over nine weed species at a concentration of 120 g of active ingredient per hectare (g ai/ha). It is worth noting that a dose of 30 g ai/ha was sufficient to achieve complete control of seven weed species. It is worth noting that one compound, <b>III-ay</b> (diethylamino carbonyl), exhibited selective inhibition of the growth of six weed species by over 90% at 30 g ai/ha while demonstrating no adverse effects on the normal growth of crops such as corn, wheat, and peanuts. A structure-activity relationship study demonstrated that carbonyl ester derivatives exhibited reduced herbicidal activity relative to their sulfonyl ester counterparts yet demonstrated enhanced crop tolerance. The results of our research indicate that the proherbicide approach has the potential to significantly enhance the efficacy and selectivity of herbicides. This strategy is poised to play a pivotal role in the advancement of next-generation herbicides.
39961693	Targeting malaria in high-risk populations in low endemic regions in northern Namibia: a quasi-experimental controlled trial to reduce malaria in seasonal agricultural workers and cattle herders.	Agricultural worksites are rarely targeted by malaria control programmes, yet may play a role in maintaining local transmission due to workers' high mobility, low intervention coverage and occupational exposures.
39961474	The potential role of ascorbic acid in attenuating infertility induced by emamectin benzoate via suppressing oxidative stress and ameliorating sperm count in male rats.	Pesticides are chemical compounds with toxicological properties. Emamectin benzoate (EMB) is a macrolytic lactone belonging to the avermectin class, produced naturally by the actinomycetes Streptomyces avermitilis. Ascorbic acid (AA) is used in many therapeutic areas, in particular for its antioxidant properties. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential role of ascorbic acid (AA) against the reproductive toxicity induced by emamectin benzoate (EMB). In this experimental study, 24 adult male rats were used. The animals were divided into 4 groups (n = 6). Control group (C) treated with distilled water, an EMB group received 20 mg EMB/kg body weight (bw) by gavage, AA group received ascorbic acid intraperitoneally (200 mg/kg bw) and an EMB + AA group received 20 mg EMB/kg bw and ascorbic acid intraperitoneally (200 mg/kg bw). The duration of the treatment was 15 days. Our results showed that the administration of EMB increased (MDA, proteins carbonyl), decreased antioxidant (SOD, CAT, GSH). Microscopic analysis revealed histological damage in the EMB group, which were represented by alteration of normal architecture, inflammatory cell infiltration, multifocal vacuolation of Sertoli cell cytoplasm, congested blood vessels, a large area of low spermatozoa density in epididymal lumen and increased collagen fibers in the muscle layer, which implicated fibrosis. However, co-treatment with ascorbic acid reduced EMB-related testis, epididymis toxicity, corrected the imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants, ameliorated sperm production, moderated amount of collagen fiber. We note that treatment with ascorbic acid (AA) only did not result in any significant change compared to controls. In conclusion, ascorbic acid has beneficial effects by attenuating the toxicity of Emamectin benzoate.
39961414	Acetamiprid-induced pulmonary toxicity via oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix accumulation in human lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts: Protective role of heat-killed Lactobacilli.	Acetamiprid (ACE) is a neonicotinoid insecticide with widespread global application, resulting in persistent human exposure. The current research examined the toxicological implications of ACE exposure on human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) and bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B cells). The following implications were explored: oxidative stress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis, cellular proliferation, and extracellular matrix accumulation. The prospective protective properties of heat-killed Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii (HKL) were further studied. The 14-day exposure to ACE at 4 μM triggered oxidative stress and inflammation. ACE promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as evidenced by the decline of protein and mRNA abundances of E-cadherin alongside increased protein and mRNA quantities of α-SMA and N-cadherin in BEAS-2B cells. Additionally, it elicited apoptosis in BEAS-2B cells and stimulated the cellular growth of MRC-5 cells. The TGF-β1/Smad pathway was activated upon ACE exposure, leading to the accumulation of extracellular matrix. HKL demonstrated antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, and anti-fibrotic properties, mitigating ACE-induced toxicity. Our findings delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial-mesenchymal transition, inflammation, oxidative stress, and extracellular matrix accumulation in ACE-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which provides new insights into pulmonary injury. Additionally, this investigation would offer us an approach to mitigate lung deterioration induced by ACE through utilizing heat-killed probiotic supplementation.
39961394	A key amino acid substitution of vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases A subunit (VATP-A) confers selective toxicity of a potential botanical insecticide, periplocoside P (PSP), in Mythimna separata and Spodoptera exigua.	Periplocosides, extracted from the root bark of Periploca sepium, are plant secondary compounds known to inhibit the V-ATPase enzyme in susceptible insect species, such as Mythimna separata. However, many species, including Spodoptera exigua, show resistance to these compounds. Previous studies identified the V-ATPase subunit A (VATP-A) in the midgut epithelium of M. separata as the putative target of periplocoside P (PSP), but the specific amino acids involved in this interaction remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrate the selective toxicity of PSP and its inhibition effect on V-ATPase. Molecular docking identified potential interactions between PSP and three amino acids (K85, R171, E199) in MsVATP-A, with in vitro binding assays revealing that K85 and R171 serve as the primary binding sites. Notably, sequence alignment revealed that R171 in sensitive species is substituted with K in resistant species. To investigate the functional implications of this substitution, we performed in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to exchange the corresponding amino acids between the VATP-A orthologs of M. separata and S. exigua. The R171K mutation in MsVATP-A reduced binding to PSP, while the K170R mutation in SeVATP-A enhanced it. Furthermore, in vivo genome editing in Drosophila melanogaster, a PSP-sensitive species, revealed that the R168K mutation conferred 15.78-fold resistance to PSP compared to the wild-type strain (w<sup>1118</sup>). Our findings confirm the role of VATP-A as the target of PSP and elucidate the key amino acids influencing its insecticidal selectivity. This research enhances the understanding of the molecular interactions between natural compounds and insect targets, offering insights for the development of targeted pest control strategies.
39961208	Cobalt MOF-hybridized nanozyme catalysts breaking pH limitations for boosted chlorpyrifos sensing performance.	Given the potential dangers of organophosphorus pesticides to food safety and human health, the development of a reliable and precise detection platform for pesticides is essential. In this study, we present a novel 'armor-plating' laccase-mimetic catalyst (DNA-Cu@MOFs)-based colorimetric platform, which enables stable and selective pesticide detection. The DNA-Cu@MOFs enhance catalytic stability and overcome pH limitations, enabling effective catalysis under neutral and alkaline physiological conditions, making them well-suited for practical applications in biosensor development. By combining the catalytic properties of DNA-Cu@MOFs with a high-affinity biorecognition element (acetylcholinesterase), the platform achieves a linear detection range of 3.0-90 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> for chlorpyrifos, with a detection limit of 0.75 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>. Notably, this platform demonstrates significant stability in chlorpyrifos detection even in the presence of environmental interferents. This robust colorimetric platform offers new possibilities for pesticide detection and provides a solid foundation for the development of comprehensive and accurate pesticide monitoring systems.
39961200	BIF-induced ROS-mediated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in embryonic cell culture of Daphnia magna.	Bifenthrin (BIF) is a widely used synthetic pyrethroid insecticide that poses significant risks to the environment, particularly to aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of BIF on Daphnia magna cells were evaluated using in vitro methods. To achieve this, we developed a novel embryonic cell culture system from D.magna using Modified Schneider's Insect Medium (MSIM), which demonstrated remarkable viability for over two months. The lethal concentration 50 (LC<sub>50</sub>) values of BIF were determined using this cell culture system through XTT (2,3-bis-(2‑methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphenyl)-(2H)-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide)assays, yielding values of 7.4 µg/mL and 4.3 µg/mL for 24 h and 48 h exposures, respectively. A fluorometric intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay was employed to measure ROS production, revealing that BIF exposure induced oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. The activities of Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were significantly reduced, indicating oxidative damage. Co-treatment with N-acetylcysteine(NAC) mitigated these effects, restoring antioxidant enzyme activity and reducing (ROS) levels. Gene expression analysis via quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) showed upregulation of stress-related genes (hsp70, hsp90) and antioxidant genes (Mn/ZnSod, cat) following exposure to LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of BIF. However, prolonged exposure led to a downregulation of these genes, suggesting cumulative effects over time. The comet assay confirmed that BIF caused genotoxicity, as evidenced by significant increases in comet and tail lengths. Co-treatment with NAC effectively mitigated these genotoxic effects. This study highlighted the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of BIF in aquatic organisms and suggested the need for environmentally friendly pest control strategies. Also, the findings confirmed the reliability of D. magna embryonic cell cultures for assessing the toxicological effects of environmental pollutants, offering new possibilities for in vitro toxicity testing at cellular and molecular levels.
39961078	Developmental pyrethroid exposure disrupts molecular pathways for MAP kinase and circadian rhythms in mouse brain.	Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a category of pervasive disorders of the developing nervous system with few or no recognized biomarkers. A significant portion of the risk for NDDs, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is contributed by the environment, and exposure to pyrethroid pesticides during pregnancy has been identified as a potential risk factor for NDD in the unborn child. We recently showed that low-dose developmental exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin in mice causes male-biased changes to ADHD- and NDD-relevant behaviors as well as the striatal dopamine system. Here, we used an integrated multiomics approach to determine the broadest possible set of biological changes in the mouse brain caused by developmental pyrethroid exposure (DPE). Using a litter-based, split-sample design, we exposed mouse dams during pregnancy and lactation to deltamethrin (3 mg/kg or vehicle every 3 days) at a concentration well below the EPA-determined benchmark dose used for regulatory guidance. We raised male offspring to adulthood, euthanized them, and pulverized and divided whole brain samples for split-sample transcriptomics, kinomics and multiomics integration. Transcriptome analysis revealed alterations to multiple canonical clock genes, and kinome analysis revealed changes in the activity of multiple kinases involved in synaptic plasticity, including the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK. Multiomics integration revealed a dysregulated protein-protein interaction network containing primary clusters for MAP kinase cascades, regulation of apoptosis, and synaptic function. These results demonstrate that DPE causes a multi-modal biophenotype in the brain relevant to ADHD and identifies new potential mechanisms of action.
39960887	Rapid screening of multiple pesticide residues in Lycii Fructus and raw juice samples by using an automated sample clean-up platform combined with GC-Q-TOF/MS.	Lycii Fructus and its raw juice are widely consumed but may be contaminated with pesticide residues, posing health risks. Traditional methods for pesticide residue detection are often labor-intensive and time-consuming.
39960882	Impact of a lambda-cyhalothrin formulation residues on larval Apis mellifera: Examining midgut and fat body morphological response to insecticide chronic exposure.	Pollination by honey bees (Apis mellifera) is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and crop yields. However, the widespread use of pesticides may threaten bees' survival by contaminating their resources. Lambda-cyhalothrin, a neurotoxic insecticide commonly used in agricultural pest control, poses particular risks. In insects, the midgut and fat body serve as primary barriers against xenobiotics, and exposure to these chemicals during larval development can impact adult bees. This study aimed to assess whether the residual concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin in pollen grains affects the midgut and fat body of larval A. mellifera workers after chronic exposure. The midgut epithelium of larvae exposed to a lambda-cyhalothrin-based insecticide exhibited autophagic vacuoles, apical cell protrusions, apocrine secretion, nuclear pyknosis, and high levels of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates in the cytoplasm, with smaller amounts in the brush border. Histochemical analysis revealed areas of vacuolation and damage to cell integrity in the midgut. In fat body cells, the insecticide increased polysaccharide storage and decreased lipid droplet diameter. Despite the histopathological damages, no effects were found in the larval development and adult emergence. These findings suggest the occurrence of apoptosis and autophagy in midgut cells and alterations in nutrient storage in the fat body of A. mellifera larvae exposed to the lambda-cyhalothrin-based insecticide, potentially impacting the physiology and development of this pollinator with possible effects on adult workers.
39960613	Elucidating the Secondary Metabolite Biosynthesis Networks in Underutilized Tree Bean (Parkia timoriana) Through Integrated Metabolomic and Transcriptomic Approaches.	The tree bean (Parkia timoriana (DC). Merr) is an underutilized legume and is abundantly found in Southeast Asia. It is valued for its nutritious pods and cultivated for food and timber. Despite of the presence of several nutrients, the regulatory networks involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in the tree bean remain largely unexplored. Recent studies have highlighted that consumption of its pods provides numerous health benefits, including antioxidant, α-glucosidase inhibitory, antibacterial, antidiabetic, and insecticidal activities. To elucidate the biosynthesis of specific metabolites in this plant, a comparative metabolite and transcriptomic analysis of the leaf and root tissues of P. timoriana was carried out. The study revealed that P. timoriana leaf and root tissues contain varying levels of phenolics, flavonoids, and terpenoids. <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) analysis identified 16 significant metabolites in the leaf and root tissues, including sugars, amino acids, and organic acids. L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), an amino acid derivative and precursor to dopamine, was detected for the first time in the seeds. Additionally, the presence of pinitol in P. timoriana was also confirmed. De novo RNA-sequence analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in both the tissues. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified pathways associated with shikimate pathway, such as phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis. MapMan pathway analysis revealed a high number of transcripts related to phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and condensed tannin biosynthesis. The research conducted identified secondary metabolites in P. timoriana, and their probable biosynthetic pathway which can be used for medicinal and nutritional purposes.
39960329	Life table study of sublethal concentrations of emamectin benzoate against Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae).	The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda J.E. Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a well-known agricultural pest in North and South America and has invaded Africa, the Far East, and Australia in the past decade. To investigate the integrated management of S. frugiperda, the sublethal impacts of emamectin benzoate were studied. Leaf-dipping bioassays were used to investigate the effects of sublethal (LC10 and LC30) concentrations of emamectin benzoate on S. frugiperda demographic parameters, and data were interpreted based on the age-stage, two-sex life table theory. The results showed that the developmental time of larvae was prolonged while the fecundity decreased after sublethal concentration treatment. Furthermore, the intrinsic and finite rates of increase, as well as the net reproductive rate, significantly declined following LC30 concentration exposure, whereas the average generation time was extended in comparison to the control group. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) dropped to 0.14 (LC10) and 0.13 (LC30)/day, compared to the control group (0.18/day). The net reproductive rate (R0) dropped from 775.40 to 303.10 and 193.30 after the LC10 and LC30 concentration treatment, respectively. In this study, sublethal concentrations of emamectin benzoate adversely affected the developmental time, fecundity, and life table parameters of S. frugiperda.
39960099	Tracking acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pesticides in the environment using the rapid transient of chlorophyll fluorescence.	Several home pesticides are organophosphorus compounds. These compounds inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, causing harmful effects on the health of biota. Through this research, the usefulness of Glycine max (soybean) and Cichorium intybus (chicory) plants as sentinels of organophosphorus compounds in the environment was successfully tested. Different concentrations of the insecticide chlorpyrifos were tried out. Damage to plants at the photosynthetic apparatus level was evaluated by measuring the high temporal resolution variable chlorophyll fluorescence (OJIP test). Several parameters derived from this test indicated a high level of damage in both species even at the mean dose recommended for use in the field. However, a few parameters did not consistently reflect damage in leaves. A drop in the values of the maximum fluorescence (F<sub>M</sub>), the quantum yield of electron transport flux, transport between quinones A and B (ET<sub>0</sub>/ABS) and the maximal quantum yield of PSII (TR<sub>0</sub>/ABS) could alert us about the presence of organophosphates in the environment. An increase in the dissipated energy flux per reaction center (DI<sub>0</sub>/RC) values was also observed. The species showed different sensitivities, with soybean plants being the most sensitive. The OJIP transient thus becomes a valuable rapid, non-destructive tool for biomonitoring this class of pesticides in the environment.
39960059	Effects of D-Tetramethrin on Zebrafish Development and Immune System.	D-tetramethrin is a common insecticide that is important for the control of mosquito-transmitted diseases such as malaria and dengue and, due to its widespread use, it is frequently detected in environmental systems. However, there is currently very little information on the influence of D-tetramethrin on non-target organisms. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to various concentrations of D-tetramethrin (0, 3, 6, and 9 mg/L) from 6 to 72 h past fertilization (hpf) to ascertain the influence of D-tetramethrin on the zebrafish immune system and development. We found that D-tetramethrin exposure led to a significant decrease in heart rate, an increase in the yolk area and tail flick frequency, and a shortening of body length in zebrafish larvae, compared with the control group. The number of macrophages and neutrophils in the experimental group of zebrafish larvae decreased significantly and the oxidative stress levels increased compared with the control group. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content increased significantly, while catalase (CAT) activity increased and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased in the experimental group. At the same time, apoptosis increased in the zebrafish embryo cells, and the expression of apoptosis-related genes such as p53, Bax, and Bcl-2 was abnormal. Moreover, the pro-inflammatory genes IL-8, IFN-γ, IL-6, and TNF-α were up-regulated, while the anti-inflammatory gene, IL-10, was down-regulated. Therefore, D-tetramethrin significantly affects the immune system and oxidative stress levels in zebrafish, inducing cell apoptosis and negatively affecting embryo development. These results provide novel data for the toxicity of D-tetramethrin and the potential adverse effects of environment residues.
39959994	Design, Synthesis, and Herbicidal Evaluation of Novel Synthetic Auxin Herbicides Containing 6-Indolylpyridine Oxime Ester/Amine.	In this study, a series of 6-indolylpyridine oxime ester/amide derivatives were synthesized as novel synthetic auxin herbicides (SAHs) for postemergence herbicidal applications. At 30 g ai/ha, compounds <b>9q</b>, <b>9u</b>, <b>9v</b> and <b>9w</b> demonstrated inhibition rates of 90 to 100% against weeds <i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i> (<i>EC</i>) and <i>Digitaria sanguinalis</i> (<i>DS</i>). Even at a reduced 7.5 g ai/ha, these compounds maintained over 90% inhibition against four broadleaf weeds, with effects comparable to those of commercial herbicides halauxifen-methyl (HAM), indolauxipyr (IND) and indolauxipyr-cyanomethyl (INC). Crop sensitivity tests confirmed the suitability of compounds <b>9w</b> and <b>9u</b> for application in wheat and rice fields at 30 g ai/ha. Molecular docking analysis revealed that compound <b>9w</b> formed significant hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions with key amino acid residues. Additionally, half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of compounds <b>9u</b> and <b>9w</b> for IAA <i>in vitro</i> inhibition activity were 6.153 and 4.389 μM, respectively, outperforming HAM (9.061 μM). Compounds <b>9u</b> and <b>9w</b> show promising potential as lead candidates for novel SAHs.
39959830	Effects of chemical fungicides combined with plant resistance inducers against <i>Bipolaris sorokiniana</i> in turfgrass.	One of the most common and causative diseases problems disease in turfgrass areas in Türkiye is leaf blight, root and crown rot caused by <i>Bipolaris sorokiniana</i>. The fungus causes great damage especially in parks, refuges, and golf courses, and needs to be managed. This study aimed to determine some activators alone or in combination with effective fungicides at different doses against <i>B. sorokiniana</i>, to reduce the use of fungicides in the control of the disease. In the study, the effects of combinations of different doses of some fungicides with <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>Arthrobacter</i> sp. and a harpin protein determined to be effective in <i>in vitro</i> studies were investigated in greenhouse and field conditions in two different provinces. The highest effect was obtained in the combination of (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>-(Azoxystrobin+Difenocazole)), which was used at the recommended dose (94.70% effect) and the recommended dose of Azoxystrobin+Difenocazole (92.57% effect). The (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>-(Azoxystrobin+Difenocazole 1st subdose)) application, in which a lower dose of fungicide was used, ranked 4th with an 89.50% effect. When <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>Arthrobacter</i> sp. and Harpin were used alone, they were found to be 82.53%, 72.17%, and 66.63% effective against the disease, respectively. As a result, environmentally friendly low-dose fungicide, and activator combination (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>-(Azoxystrobin+Difenocazole 1. subdose)), and (<i>Arthrobacter</i> sp.-(Epoxiconazole+Pyraclostrobin 1st sub-dose)) applications were found to be promising in the control of <i>B. sorokiniana</i> in turfgrass areas. When considered only as an activator application, the 82.53% effect value obtained in <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> applications was found to be promising for the disease. It can be recommended as a disease suppressant, and at the same time environmentally friendly application.
39959655	Bean leaf image dataset annotated with leaf dimensions, segmentation masks, and camera calibration.	Leaf dimensioning is relevant for analyzing plant responses to several conditions such as soil fertility, availability of light, agricultural pesticide effect, and access to water in the soil or periods of drought. In this paper, we present a dataset composed of 6981 images of 612 common bean leaves (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>). We captured the images of each leaf accompanied by a fiducial marker and annotated the known leaf dimensions (area, perimeter, length, and width). We provide annotations concerning image segmentation, known area uniformly distributed over the leaf region, real area of the marker region, marker pose, capture conditions, and camera calibration. This dataset can be useful for developing deep learning algorithms for leaf dimensioning and related problems. Therefore, there is a potential to contribute to computer vision and plant physiology researchers and specialists.
39959498	Beneficial arthropods threatened by synthetic agricultural pesticides around the southeast slopes of Mount Cameroon.	Agriculture is among the main drivers of global biodiversity decline. This research assessed the ecological risk of synthetic pesticides at the southeast slopes of Mount Cameroon on bees and other non-target arthropods (NTAs) using the PRIMET (Pesticide RIsk in the tropics to Man, Environment and Trade) model. Data on pesticide usage (active ingredients, interval, dosage, number of applications), and ecotoxicology (LD<sub>50</sub> and environmental behaviour) were collected from field surveys and the IUPAC databases, respectively, then imported into PRIMET to assess the level of risk expressed in Exposure Toxicity Ratio (ETR). Tomato was the main crop of the area while insecticides were the main pesticide category utilised in the study area. Nine (09) compounds were predicted to pose a "risk" to bees namely abamectin, fipronil, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, emamectin-benzoate, cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, indoxacarb and ethoprophos. Abamectin had the highest ETR in the group (NEC<sub>bee</sub> = 0.05 g a.i./ha; ETR<sub>bee</sub> = 20000). Fifteen (15) active ingredients were predicted by the model to pose a certain in-field risk to NTAs with lambda-cyhalothrin at the top position (AEC<sub>NTA</sub> = 0.0034 g a.i./ha; ETR<sub>IF</sub> = 1147000). There was evidence that insecticides were of more risk to beneficial arthropods, as compared to other types of pesticides. Pesticides active ingredients such as abamectin, fipronil, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, emamectin-benzoate, cypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin that were predicted to pose "Risk" both to bees and others NTAs require serious mitigation strategies (biological control, improve cultural practices, target application, farmer's education).
39959428	Metallothionein II treatment mitigates rotenone-induced neurodegeneration in zebrafish models of Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting motor function due to progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Current therapies offer symptomatic relief but fail to halt disease progression, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. This study explores the neuroprotective potential of exogenous human metallothionein 2 (hMT2) peptide in a rotenone-induced PD zebrafish model.

39959275	DNA methylation in the association between pesticide exposures and type 2 diabetes.	Numerous epidemiological studies have found that pesticide exposure is associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. DNA methylation may play a role in this process.
39959051	Predictive Modeling of Pesticides Reproductive Toxicity in Earthworms Using Interpretable Machine-Learning Techniques on Imbalanced Data.	The earthworm is a key indicator species in soil ecosystems. This makes the reproductive toxicity of chemical compounds to earthworms a desired property of determination and makes computational models necessary for descriptive and predictive purposes. Thus, the aim was to develop an advanced Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling approach for this complex property with imbalanced data. The approach integrated gradient-boosted decision trees as classifiers with a genetic algorithm for feature selection and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. An additional goal was to analyze and interpret, using SHAP values, the structural features encoded by the molecular descriptors that contribute to pesticide toxicity and nontoxicity, the most notable of which are solvation entropy and a number of hydrolyzable bonds. The final model was constructed as a stacked ensemble of models and combined the strengths of the individual models. Evaluation of this model with an external test set of 147 compounds demonstrated a well-defined applicability domain and sufficient predictive capabilities with a Balanced Accuracy of 77%. The model representation follows FAIR principles and is available on QsarDB.org.
39958986	Statement on the update of maximum residue levels (MRLs) for copper compounds in light of the EFSA scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of the health-based guidance values (HBGVs) and exposure assessment from all sources.	In compliance with Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the maximum residue levels (MRLs) for copper compounds in light of the EFSA Scientific Committee opinion on the re-evaluation of the health-based guidance values (HBGVs) and exposure assessment from all sources. Based on the exposure calculations performed according to three different scenarios, the updated occurrence data and the residues from the new intended uses are not expected to have an impact on the chronic exposure calculations conducted under the framework of the EFSA Scientific Committee assessment. Therefore, the conclusions of the previous assessment by EFSA Scientific Committee are still valid. Since the current copper exposure is expected to cover all sources of copper, including the uses of copper as plant protection products (PPPs), it can be concluded that the authorised PPP uses for copper compounds and the new intended PPP uses present no health risk for the population, including children. Due to copper being also a micronutrient and ubiquitous in the environment, as requested in the mandate, the dietary risk assessment was performed following a different approach than the standard methodology for the dietary risk assessment of pesticide residues in the framework of setting and reviewing MRLs under Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and in the peer review of pesticides under Regulation (EU) No 1107/2009. Therefore, all MRL proposals are suggested for further consideration by risk managers.
39957376	Can malaria be eliminated? 15 years on.	This commentary reflects on the ongoing challenges and strategies in malaria elimination, built on insights from Greenwood's 2009 commentary, alongside more recent publications and developments up to 2024. Many of the challenges and strategies discussed by Greenwood remain relevant today. Furthermore, several of Greenwood's predictions have proven accurate 15 years on. Despite significant global progress, malaria elimination faces its toughest challenge, particularly in high-transmission areas. As we confront tougher challenges in malaria elimination, it becomes clear that we must go beyond mere reliance on any single solution.
39956961	Bio-based two-dimensional amphiphile with hierarchical self-assembly for enhancing pesticide utilization and reducing environmental risks.	Biotic and abiotic stresses threaten crop growth and yield. Agrochemicals are an important way to mitigate biotic stress, while frequent low utilization and potential environmental risk affect their sustainable use. In order to improve pesticide utilization, it is common practice to add tank-mix adjuvants by reducing surface tension or forming spherical self-assembly. However, there is a lack of quantitative indicators to screen suitable molecules for sustainable application. In this work, critical factors based on physicochemical properties, and kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are applied to analyze regulatory mechanisms in dynamic processes, and ultimately to establish an integrated strategy for the management of stresses.
39956931	A point mutation in IAA34 confers resistance to the auxin herbicide 2,4-D in Sisymbrium orientale.	Sisymbrium orientale has evolved resistance to 2,4-D in Australia due to a 27 bp deletion in SoIAA2. However, one population of Sisymbrium orientale resistant to 2,4-D (R1) did not contain the SoIAA2<sub>Δ27</sub>, suggesting another 2,4-D resistance mechanism was present in this population. Here, we reported a novel target-site resistance mechanism of 2,4-D in the R1 population.
39956922	Evaluation of warfarin dose and INR time in therapeutic range in left ventricular assist device patients with sleeve gastrectomy.	Sleeve gastrectomy is safe and effective in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and morbid obesity to improve candidacy for transplantation and increase survival rates. Literature describing warfarin anticoagulation in this population is limited. A single-center, propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort study was conducted to determine if sleeve gastrectomy in LVAD-implanted patients has an effect on warfarin dose requirements in the outpatient setting. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were 18 years of age or older, underwent LVAD implant at the study center, and were discharged from the hospital on warfarin therapy. They must have at least 8 weeks of available follow-up data post-discharge. Propensity matching was utilized to identify a non-sleeve gastrectomy LVAD-only patients for comparison. A total of 96 LVAD-only patients and 48 LVAD plus sleeve gastrectomy patients were included in the final analysis. Outpatient warfarin requirements increased from baseline over time in both groups, with no significant differences between groups except at month 12, with a mean total weekly dose of 38.1 ± 21.4 mg in the LVAD only group and 46.8 ± 18.6 mg in the LVAD with sleeve gastrectomy group (<i>p</i> = 0.05). The sleeve gastrectomy group had a significantly lower warfarin doses per kilogram of body weight until month 6 post-discharge. The percent time in therapeutic range was significantly lower in the SG group at the 8 week, 3 month, and 6 month interval time point. There were no significant differences in the incidence of bleeding or thromboembolic events.
39956894	Investigating the molecular mechanisms of deltamethrin resistance in Musca domestica populations from Saudi Arabia.	The house fly, Musca domestica L., is a global insect pest that poses serious health risks by carrying pathogens to humans and animals. Pyrethroid (PYR) insecticides have been widely used to control agricultural pests and disease vectors. Multiple reports have documented house fly resistance to PYR insecticides.
39956838	Long-term effect of Bt cottonseed cake on nutrient utilisation, growth performance and health of rams in tropical conditions.	Cottonseed cake (CSC) is a cost-effective and important protein source for ruminants. In India, Bt cotton has replaced 96% of non-Bt, making Bt CSC, the predominant byproduct available for animal feeding. While some studies have assessed the effect of Bt genes and proteins on livestock health, no long-term evaluations have been conducted. This study investigated the prolonged effects of feeding Bt cottonseed cake on growth performance, feed intake, and blood parameters in rams, particularly within tropical systems Eighteen male rams were divided into three treatment groups: G<sub>1</sub> (0% CSC), G<sub>2</sub> (35% non-Bt CSC), and G<sub>3</sub> (35% Bt CSC). The results revealed that body weight (30.50 to 30.90 kg), dry matter intake (3.22 to 2.28 kg/100 kg body weight), and nutrient digestibility had non-significant differences among the treatments. The nitrogen (N) intake ranged from 16.87 to 17.20 g/day, and N retention was between 15.74% and 17.38%. Similarly, blood metabolites (plasma protein, creatinine, and superoxide dismutase) were found within the normal range. Semen volume (0.85 to 0.90 mL), sperm count (3475-3500 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mL), and sperm motility (75.2-76.05%) were also within normal ranges. The results of the experiment indicate that no apparent detrimental effects were observed from long-term (320 days) feeding of Bt cottonseed cake at up to 35% in the concentrate mixture for rams.
39956757	Plants as biofactories for production of the aphid sex pheromone nepetalactone.	Aphids cause massive agricultural losses through direct damage or as pathogen vectors. Control often relies on insecticides, which are expensive and not selective. An interesting alternative is to use aphid sex pheromones nepetalactone (NON) and nepetalactol (NOL) to interfere with aphid mating or attract aphid predators. Here, we explore production of these compounds in plants, as their precursors can be derived from mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. By introducing six genes, including a major latex protein-like (MLPL) enzyme, we engineered a functional nepetalactol biosynthetic pathway into plants. Transient expression of these enzymes in N. benthamiana caused production of nepetalactone, without the need for external supplementation with substrates. Targeting all six enzymes into the chloroplast appeared to result in higher NON yields than just chloroplast-targeting the first two enzymes. We could not detect NOL, suggesting it is rapidly oxidised to NON. In addition, we produced NON in stably transformed Camelina sativa (Camelina) lines. Interestingly, the specific NON enantiomer was different in N. benthamiana compared to in Camelina, indicating the value of different platforms for producing specific isoforms. This opens possibilities for using plants as green factories of pheromones for baits or as pheromone dispensers that interfere with insect behaviour.
39956508	Efficient removal of Lambda-cyhalothrin from simulated water using Co-composted-biochar: A modern day substituent of conventional bioadsorbent.	Lambda-cyhalothrin, a type II pyrethroid, is widely employed as an outdoor and indoor insect repellent due to its target specificity and moderate toxicity. However, its extensive use elevated its residual concentration to significant detectable levels in waterbodies, making it an immediate problem. Furthermore, as a lipophile, its accumulation in multicellular organisms has resulted in irreversible acute and chronic effects on numerous physiochemical and biological activities. Thus, to address its removal as a pollutant from waterbodies, bio-adsorbents are considered a cost-effective and environmentally sound cleanup method. Modern day bio-adsorbents like co-composted-biochar, because of their potential adsorption capability rather than the conventional ones, may become a commonly used remediation tool. Therefore, this study aims at producing co-composted-biochar (COMBI) by combining kitchen-derived putrescible waste and biochar to effectively remove Lambda-cyhalothrin (LC) from spiked up water. It has been further analysed for its physico-chemical characteristics using instrumentation such as BET, SEM-EDS and FTIR. The results showed that biochar and COMBI had a much greater surface area (2.174 m<sup>2</sup>/g-1.718 m<sup>2</sup>/g) and pore diameters (3.648 nm-3.628 nm) than the compost sample. Simultaneously, the response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimise the removal efficiency of COMBI against LC. A Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was developed with an experimental layout to perform tests for determining the effects of four basic parameters i.e. pH, contact time (minute), adsorbate concentration (g/l) and adsorbent dose (g) on (%) removal of LC. It was noted that variation among removal efficiencies for the experimental runs ranges between 94.8% and 99.9%, within the majority attaining an efficiency of greater than 95%. During the experiments, the ideal conditions were found to be as pH 2 in a contact time of 140 min and a dose of adsorbent 0.01 g. Thus, COMBI could be a promising and potential candidate for the elimination of LC.
39956507	Taxonomic and functional fingerprints in the gut microbiota of Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis) inhabiting organic and conventional farming fields.	Intensive farming leading to both landscape homogenization and massive use of pesticides is threatening biodiversity associated with agricultural landscapes. Pesticides may alter the composition of the gut microbiota, which contributes critically to a variety of host metabolic and immune functions, and the consequences on wildlife health are still unknown. We studied potential effects of farming practices on the gut microbiota of wild Iberian hare populations (Lepus granatensis) inhabiting conventional (synthetic pesticide-treated, mostly glyphosate) and organic (synthetic pesticide-free) farming areas in Central Spain. We analyzed duodenum, caecum, and rectum sections and fresh feces by massive 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our study supports the use of fresh feces as a non-invasive proxy for monitoring dynamic changes in the gut community. The gut metacommunity under conventional farming showed higher richness and diversity (both ecological and phylogenetic) but with more homogeneous composition among hares (lower beta-dispersion) than the gut metacommunity detected in organic farming areas. We did not observe dysbiosis or significant enrichment in pathogenic bacteria. Potential negative effects on community-level abilities for vegetable fiber degradation were observed in conventional farming fields. Ruminococcaceae, which play a key role as cellulose degraders, showed significant lower relative abundances in conventional fields and lower potential for the butyrate metabolism. We show a gut index based on the ratio of fecal Ruminococcaceae that may be helpful for predictive environmental diagnostics. Further experimental research and in situ monitoring of gut microbiota are needed to substantiate these findings and to fully understand the potential undesired effects of synthetic pesticides in untargeted wildlife.
39955993	Spatial analysis of uptake and accumulation of metalaxyl, spirotetramat, and spirotetramat-enol in maize at the micrometer scale using HPLC-HRMS and MALDI-MSI.	Plant protection products (PPPs) are applied on a global scale in vast quantities, which results in elevated concentrations of active ingredients in the soil pore water. Depending on their fate, these PPPs have the potential to pose a threat to the environment and surrounding ecosystems. PPPs that are dissolved in the soil pore water are available for uptake by crop roots, which can lead to bioaccumulation in different plant parts, depending on the characteristics of the PPPs used. The quantity of the active ingredients absorbed and the fate of these substances within the plant are contingent upon the specific uptake routes. We exposed young maize plants to metalaxyl and spirotetramat or its metabolite spirotetramat-enol in a hydroponic setup. We investigated the root uptake and subsequent translocation to shoots via Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry. Furthermore, MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) was employed to elucidate the accumulation of metalaxyl and spirotetramat in specific organs of maize on a micrometer scale. This study demonstrates that both PPPs are readily taken up via the roots of maize plants yet differ significantly in their distribution. MALDI-MSI is particularly important to get a better mechanistic understanding. Thus, metalaxyl accumulates in the xylem and is predominantly found in the leaves whereas spirotetramat accumulates in the root epidermis. These new insights are helpful for the environmental impact assessment and MALDI-MSI an exciting new aspect to consider in environmental analysis.
39955984	Ecotoxicological mechanism of glyphosate on Moerella iridescens: Evidence from enzyme, histology and metabolome.	This study aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of glyphosate (GLY) on rainbow clam (M. iridescens), with implications for their culture and conservation. GLY residues in aquatic systems raise significant environmental and public health concerns, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. In this study, M. iridescens were acutely exposed to GLY at various concentrations (0, 2.34, 5.45, 12.74, 29.74, and 69.46 mg/L) for 7 days. Gill and hepatopancreas samples were collected to assess oxidative stress status and histopathological examination. Additionally, three concentration groups low concentration (LC) group at 2.34 mg/L, medium concentration (MC) group at 12.74 mg/L, and high concentration (HC) group at 69.46 mg/L were selected for metabolomic analysis. The findings indicated that GLY exposure led to oxidative stress and structural changes in tissues. The metabolomic analysis suggested that GLY exposure exacerbates inflammatory responses and disrupts endocrine function, and sex hormones.
39955948	Anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory activity of linalool against formaldehyde and complete Freund's adjuvant induced arthritis in rats.	Arthritis, characterized by persistent joint inflammation, poses a significant challenge due to its detrimental effects on cartilage function and subchondral bone health. This study investigates the potential pharmacological effects of linalool, a monoterpene alcohol commonly found in essential oils, as a promising treatment for arthritis. In vitro assays, including red blood cell membrane stability and protein denaturation tests, were conducted to preliminarily assess the anti-arthritic potential of linalool. Preclinical evaluations were performed on rats with arthritis induced by formaldehyde and complete Freund's adjuvant, focusing on the therapeutic effects of orally administered linalool over a 28-day period. Linalool treatment resulted in significant improvements in body weight, reduced paw inflammation, and decreased arthritis symptoms. Hematological and biochemical analyses revealed that linalool reduced lipid peroxidation and elevated antioxidant levels in arthritic rats. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated a notable downregulation of pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-1β, IRAK, NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-17, alongside an upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, in linalool-treated rats compared to controls. These results suggest that linalool is promising as an alternative therapeutic intervention for inflammatory joint diseases.
39955940	Widespread detection of second generation anticoagulant rodenticides in Australian native marsupial carnivores.	Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) have been detected in non-target wildlife species worldwide but information on exposure in Australian mammals is extremely limited. To address this, we analysed liver tissue from the five largest sized species of native Australian carnivorous and scavenging mammals for all SGARs currently used in Australia. A total of 52 individual animals from five dasyurid species were tested for exposure to ARs with 26 individuals (50 %) testing positive. Eleven individuals (21 %) tested positive for more than one AR compound, and two individuals tested positive for three types of AR. This study is the first to document widespread and pervasive AR exposure in native Australian marsupial carnivores, including those in remote locations away from towns. The frequency and severity of exposure, sometimes from multiple ARs suggest potential population-level impacts on these threatened species. These findings provide further evidence that ARs should be listed as a key threatening process under state and federal legislation and that the federal regulator (Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicine Authority) should restrict the widespread sale of SGARs in line with other countries.
39955839	Magnetically controlled all-in-one sensing platform for triple-mode detection of organophosphorus pesticides using DNA tetrahedrons-polydopamine reporters.	Accurate and on-site detection of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) in complex matrixes is important for environmental monitoring and food safety. Herein, a colorimetric (CL), photothermal (PT) and fluorescence (FL) triple-mode sensor was constructed for OPs detection based on magnetically controlled all-in-one platform, which was featured of specific recognition unit, abundant loading of DNA tetrahedrons-Fe<sup>3+</sup>-polydopamine (TDN-Fe<sup>3+</sup>-PDA) with peroxidase-like activity, and verifiable triple-mode signal output. Based on the aptamer-target recognition and efficient separation of MBs, large amount of TDN-Fe<sup>3+</sup>-PDA reporters was released. Taking full advantages of the supernatant and precipitation, OPs was sensitively detected with the TDN-Fe<sup>3+</sup>-PDA catalyzed 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system (CL mode), photothermal effect of TDN-Fe<sup>3+</sup>-PDA and oxidized TMB (oxTMB) (PT mode), and fluorescent signal of TDN-templated copper nanoclusters on MBs (FL mode). Using profenofos (Pro) as the model target, the triple-mode sensing platform realized sensitive detection of Pro with the detection limits 0.23 ng/mL, 0.40 ng/mL and 0.14 ng/mL for CL, PT and FL mode, respectively. The proposed strategy provided a simple and accurate method for on-site detection of OPs, holding promising application in environmental and food contamination monitoring.
39955488	Eco-friendly nano colloids for enhanced black gram (Vigna mungo) seed viability: experimental and computational analysis.	An experiment was designed to fabricate Polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated zein-zipped herbal molecules infused nano colloids (PZCA-NCs) for extending Vigna mungo seeds storability. PZCA-NCs was synthesized and characterized in Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Particle size analyser, Zeta Potential, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX). The bio-efficacy of PZCA-NCs on seed storability was tested under accelerated ageing. The sphere-shaped PZCA-NCs possess a 151 nm size with 44.5mV zeta potential at an encapsulation of 73.44% curcumin and 69.0% azadirachtin. The spectra of FTIR, UV -Vis, XRD, and TGA confirmed the functionality, composition, and stability of PZCA-NCs. The dialysis diffusion method was utilised to study the maximum cumulative release of biomolecules 6.1ppm (88.4%) azadirachtin and 64.57ppm (88.2%) curcumin at pH 7.4. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to determine the binding mode of molecules and examine ligand interactions in PZCA-NCs. PZCA-NCs treated seeds at 25 mL/kg enumerated higher germination, vigour index, α-amylase, dehydrogenase, and catalase and peroxidase activity under ageing. Seeds storage pathogen infection was reduced with an increase in the concentration of PZCA-NCs coating. The bioassay results on insect activity evidenced that PZCA-NCs at 15.76 mL/kg killed 50% and 40 mL/kg killed 100% of the storage insect Callosobruchus maculatus. Toxicity study on Macrophomina phaseolina showed that PZCA-NCs at 35 mL resulted in 0.8 cm mycelia growth with 91.11% inhibition zone, while at 45 mL had zero growth of fungal mycelia with 100% inhibition. The study concludes that PZCA-NCs act as an efficient seed invigoration material to extend the vitality of Vigna mungo seeds during ageing.
39955400	Quantification of Pesticides and In Vitro Effects of Water-Soluble Fractions of Agricultural Soils in South Africa.	Although agrochemicals protect crops and reduce losses, these chemicals can migrate to non-target environments via run-off and leaching following irrigation or heavy rainfall, where non-target organisms can be exposed to a mixture of water-soluble compounds. This study investigated whether the water-soluble fractions of selected agricultural soils from South Africa contain quantifiable concentrations of four commonly used pesticides, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), atrazine, dicamba and imidacloprid, and whether the aqueous extracts induce effects in vitro. Effects investigated included cytotoxicity using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] cell viability assay; xenobiotic metabolism using the H4IIE-luc rat hepatoma cell line; and (anti-)androgenic and (anti-)oestrogenic effects were screened for with the human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-kb2 and T47D-KBluc, respectively. Oxidative stress responses were measured in H4IIE-luc and human duodenum adenocarcinoma (HuTu-80) cells. All extracts of soil induced oxidative stress, while several samples caused moderate to severe cytotoxicity and/or anti-androgenic effects. The herbicide atrazine had the greatest frequency of detection (89%), followed by dicamba (84%), 2,4-D (74%) and imidacloprid (32%). Concentrations of atrazine [2.0 × 10<sup>-1</sup> to 2.1 × 10<sup>2</sup> ng/g, dry mass (dm)] and the neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid (2.0 × 10<sup>1</sup> to 9.7 × 10<sup>1</sup> ng/g, dm), exceeded international soil quality guidelines. Overall, there was no observable trend between the biological effects and pesticides quantified. Nonetheless, the findings of this study show that agricultural soils in South Africa can elicit effects in vitro and contain quantifiable concentrations of polar pesticides. These agrochemicals might pose risks to the health of humans and the environment, but more assessment is necessary to quantify such potential effects.
39955043	Trichothecroamides A‒F, antifungal amides from potato associated fungus Trichothecium crotocinigenum.	Potato is the most important non-cereal food crop in the world. Phytophthora infestans and Rhizoctonia solani are responsible for the cause of late blight and black scurf of potato, respectively, which take a decline of potato production and serious economic loss to the producers. As a continuation of the search of natural fungicides from the secondary metabolites of potato associated fungus Trichothecium crotocinigenum, five previously undescribed amide derivatives trichothecroamides A‒E, one previously undescribed cyclopeptide trichothecroamide F, together with three known cyclopeptides, have been obtained. Their structures were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis, as well as quantum chemistry calculations on ECD. Trichothecroamide A and two known cyclopeptides showed moderate antifungal activities against P. infestans and R. solani with MIC values of 16-64 μg/mL, which could be applied as potential anti-pathogenic agents for potato fungal diseases.
39954929	Triazoles in the environment: An update on occurrence, fate, health hazards, and removal techniques.	The triazole fungicides are widely utilized in agriculture and have the potential to leach into surface water from agricultural fields, resulting in significant environmental contamination. Prolonged exposure to triazole fungicides may pose potential risks to human health. Therefore, it is imperative to develop rapid, cost-effective, and efficient methods for the removal of triazoles in order to mitigate their detrimental impact on both the environment and human health. The present study provides a comprehensive review of the occurrence, distribution, and fate of triazoles in the general environment. Furthermore, an extensive comparison of current removal techniques, encompassing biodegradation, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and adsorption in various environmental samples, is thoroughly discussed. AOPs-based methods are currently the most widely utilized removal technology and represent a primary direction for future development. The application of hybrid removal techniques presents promising opportunities for the development of innovative methods for triazole removal. The paper also provides an analysis of the advantages/disadvantages and challenges associated with triazoles removal. In conclusion, this comprehensive review offers an in-depth evaluation of state-of-the-art technologies for triazoles removal.
39954825	The impact of triadimenol on male fertility: An in vitro study and molecular docking examination.	Triadimenol, a triazole fungicide, induces various adverse effects including neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and developmental/reproductive toxicity in non-target organisms. Occupational exposure generally occurs in male agricultural workers. Investigating the effects of triadimenol on three different testicular cell lines would be valuable in elucidating the mechanisms underlying male reproductive issues or infertility. This preliminary study examines the potential toxic effects of triadimenol exposure in Leydig (TM3), Sertoli (TM4), and mouse-derived Spermatogonia (GC-1) cell lines, which are representative of the male reproductive system in vitro. The median inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of triadimenol were found to be 121.35 μM, 332.1 μM, and 349.49 μM in TM3, TM4, and GC-1 cells, respectively. The exposure doses were determined to range from 0 to 100 µM in TM3 cell line and 0-300 µM in TM4 and GC-1 cell lines. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced glutathione (GSH) content, malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl levels, and genotoxicity were examined. TM3 cell line was more resistant to oxidative damage than the other cell lines, while TM4 cell line was found to be more sensitive in terms of protein carbonyl formation. Triadimenol damaged DNA in TM3 cell line (≥16.93), TM4 cell line (≥9.18), and GC-1 cell line (≥3.28). Additionally, the docking score of triadimenol on the active site of steroid 5-α-reductase 2 (5αR2), which converts testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone, was not close. The results emphasised that the toxicity of triadimenol was cell-specific. Overall, triadimenol disrupted male fertility by affecting spermatogenesis, testosterone production, germ cell support, and sperm quality.
39954767	A network toxicology and molecular docking-based approach revealed shared hepatotoxic mechanisms and targets between the herbicide 2,4-D and its metabolite 2,4-DCP.	The herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and its major environmental metabolite 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) are pollutants associated with hepatotoxicity, whose molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigated the molecular pathways and targets involved in 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP-induced hepatotoxicity using protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses and molecular docking. Target genes were identified using PharmMapper and SwissTargetPrediction, and cross-referenced with hepatotoxicity-related genes from GeneCards and OMIM databases. The PPI network, constructed via STRING and visualized in Cytoscape, revealed 12 critical hub nodes, including HSP90AA1, RXRA, EGFR, SRC, CREBBP, PIK3R1, ESR1, AKT1, RAF1, IGF1R, MDM2, and MAPK14. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated processes such as apoptosis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipid metabolism impairment, while Reactome pathway analysis highlighted disruptions in PI3K/AKT and nuclear receptors signaling. Molecular docking confirmed significant interactions of 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP with key proteins, including SRC, AKT, RXRA, MDM2, and HSP90AA1. These results suggest that 2,4-D and 2,4-DCP share similar toxic mechanisms, providing new insights into their hepatotoxicity pathways for the first time.
39954757	Acute toxicity and sublethal effects of thiamethoxam on the stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica: Survival, neural morphology, and enzymatic responses.	Native and cultivated plants in the Neotropics benefit from the pollination services provided by stingless bees. The use of neonicotinoid insecticides negatively impacts bee health, even though bees are not their primary targets. This study determined the oral mean lethal concentration (LC<sub>50</sub>) of thiamethoxam (TMX) after 24 h of exposure for the stingless bee Scaptotrigona postica. Based on the LC₅₀ value (0.11 ng a.i./μL) obtained, two fractions of this value (1/10 and 1/100 LC₅₀) were selected to assess survival time (LT₅₀), as well as to conduct neural morphological and enzymatic analyses. The LC₅₀/100 group had a LT₅₀ of 15 days, compared to 17 days in the control group, while the LC₅₀/10 group survived for 8 days. Morphological analyses revealed increased Kenyon cell spacing and pyknosis in the mushroom bodies after 1, 3, and 6 days of exposure, suggesting that thiamethoxam adversely affects the brain of S. postica. Regarding enzymatic activity, comparisons between the control and the two sublethal concentrations revealed that Carboxylesterase and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity increased in the abdomens after six days of exposure. GST activity also increased in the bees' heads for the LC₅₀/10 concentration after six days of exposure (Control x TMX group). The enzymatic results suggests that thiamethoxam induces oxidative stress in S. postica. The results presented underscore the necessity of considering stingless bees in regulatory decisions regarding the use of insecticides, ensuring that the risks to this important group of pollinators are adequately assessed.
39954642	Effects of sophorolipids and coconut wax incorporation on the physical, structural, and antibacterial properties of cellulose nanofibers-based Pickering emulsion for cherry tomato preservation.	A novel acidic sophorolipid-enhanced cellulose nanofiber-based coconut wax Pickering emulsion (ASL-CCPE) using cellulose nanofibers (CNF) as a stabilizer, lactonic sophorolipids (LSL) as an antimicrobial agent, and acidic sophorolipids (ASL) as a co-stabilizer were developed. Through optimization of the oil phase type, oil-to-water ratio, and ASL content, the emulsion exhibited shear-thinning behavior and elastic gel characteristics, making it suitable for coating applications. After 182 days of storage at room temperature, the emulsion's droplet size remained uniform, with no significant flocculation observed. Compared to CCPE, ASL-CCPE exhibited reduced surface tension and formed a more uniform, dense, and washable coating. Cherry tomatoes coated with ASL-CDPE remained fresh for at least 12 days at room temperature. Furthermore, ASL-CCPE treatment resulted in a 5.10 % reduction in weight loss and a 45.83 % increase in vitamin C content even after 15 days of storage. Additionally, the inclusion of LSL significantly inhibited microbial growth, thus reducing decay. This green, safe, and effective emulsion offers a promising, environmentally friendly approach for fruit and vegetable preservation.
39954586	Insecticidal nanoformulations based on a lipid matrix: Physicochemical properties and their effect on non-target aquatic biota.	The incorporation of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC) in lipid nanoparticles (LN) could be a sustainable strategy to increase its efficacy and decrease its hazard to the environment. The purpose of the present work was to perform the interaction between LC and LN after nanoencapsulation and to evaluate their effect on species from different aquatic trophic levels such as Aliivibrio fischeri, Raphidocelis subcapitata, Lemna minor, and Daphnia magna. LN loaded with LC (LN-LC) were produced by green and simple methodology without organic solvents using Precirol ATO5® and Capryol 90® as solid and liquid lipids, respectively, and soy lecithin and TEGO® Care as emulsifiers. The physicochemical interaction between LC and LN was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray, confirming that LC is associated with the lipid lattice of nanoparticles, characterized by an amorphous matrix. The data from biological tests showed no or low toxicity of LN-LC on the selected aquatic organisms. Thus, encapsulation in lipid-based nanoparticles may be a promising and sustainable choice for using this insecticide in agricultural practices, reducing its environmental risk.
39954581	Application of deep eutectic solvents for the simultaneous determination of organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides in aqueous matrices and the assessment of its level of whiteness.	This work presents as a novelty the development of a method for the simultaneous determination of organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides in aqueous samples using only deep eutectic solvents (DES) followed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Combining 4 hydrogen bond acceptors and 6 hydrogen bond donors, 17 DES were prepared. Menthol:thymol in a 1:1 molar ratio presented the best extraction performance and was, therefore, characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), hydrogen-nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY-NMR), comparing the spectra from the pure components and from the DES. In the FTIR analysis, the main shifts occurred in the CO bonds. The NMR analyses allowed a better understanding of the interactions occurring during solvent formation, which were attributed to the interaction between the hydroxyls from menthol and thymol. Vortex-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) required no dispersing solvents. The main variables affecting the extraction were optimized using full factorial design, including a triplicate center point. For a fixed 10-mL sample volume, the optimum ranges obtained were: 3.0 ± 0.60 g of NaCl, pH in the range from 5 to 9, a vortex stirring time of 4 ± 2 min and 150 μL of a DES composed of menthol and thymol in a 1:1 molar ratio. Satisfactory figures of merit were then obtained: coefficients of determination greater than 0.99, linear working ranges from 1 μg/L to 400 μg/L, limit of detections of 0.3 μg/L, an inter-day precision from 1.33 % to 9.86 % (n = 12), and an intra-day precision from 4.65 % to 15.52 % (n = 4). The application was carried out in six different aqueous matrices, with methyl parathion being detected in a lake sample. An excellent mean recovery of 98.0 % was obtained for the three levels evaluated and all analytes. The comparison with other methods was based on the principles of White Analytical Chemistry using Algorithm 12, by which the method proposed in this work showed a higher level of whiteness compared to the others.
39954525	Solvatochromic fluorophores based on 6-fluoro-2-(aryl)quinoline-4-carboxylic acids: Synthesis, optical studies and evaluation of their antimicrobial and larvicidal properties.	6-Fluoro-2-(aryl)quinoline-4-carboxylic acids 1-11 were synthesized via Pfitzinger reactions between 5-fluoroisatin and methyl aryl ketones. The molecules were studied regarding the impact of their substituent patterns (a-e) on their optical and bioactivity properties. All compounds were fluorescent in solution and had significant solvatochromic behavior, measured in tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, methanol, and water at different pHs. Compounds emitted in a broad spectral range from ultraviolet to green, with quantum efficiencies, varying from very weak (ex.: <0.5 % for 1a in DMSO and MeOH) to moderate-strong (∼35 % for 11e in dichloromethane). A biomonitoring of the synthetized compounds reveals antimicrobial and larvicidal (Aedes aegypti mosquitoes) profile. Gram-positive bacterial and fungal species showed greater sensitivity to the 11e, that presented both bactericidal and fungicidal nature. This compound with a methylenedioxy substituent showed favourable interactions with Dehydrosqualene synthase (DQS) and Squalene synthase (SQS), well-validated antimicrobial targets, considering key residues in the complex formation. The molecule also presented a good larvicidal profile, ranking second in terms of significant LC50 values. Thus, 11e has demonstrated an advantage scaffold for future biological tests in other organisms or at the cellular level.
39954470	Evaluation of the concentrations of current use pesticides (CUPs) in urban air and rainfall, and their wet deposition flux in a metropolitan environment.	This study assesses the wet deposition fluxes and washout ratios of current-use pesticides (CUPs) in Bursa, Turkey, to better understand their environmental impact. It investigates the temporal and spatial fluctuations of these compounds, particularly focusing on CUPs like benomyl, dichlorvos, dimethoate, imidacloprid, monochrotophos, and pymetrozine. The concentrations of CUPs in both ambient air and precipitation showed seasonal variations, with peaks in spring and summer due to increased agricultural activities. Precipitation concentrations of CUPs also varied, when the detection rates based on CUP congeners are analyzed, benomyl (70 %) and pymetrozine (66 %) are the most frequently detected congeners in the collected samples, particularly during the peak agricultural season. Wet deposition fluxes were highest in spring and summer, while dry deposition fluxes peaked in autumn and winter. Benomyl, dichlorvos, dimethoate, and imidacloprid were determined the most abundant CUP congeners in both phase (gas and particle phase). The dry deposition velocities ranged from 0.001 to 2.26 cm/s, and washout ratios varied between 1.35 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and 1.18 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, depending on the CUP congeners. These findings underscore the need for ongoing monitoring, enhanced measurement techniques, and interdisciplinary collaboration to better understand CUP distribution and its environmental and health impacts, while developing effective management strategies.
39954422	Cellulose-derived biocatalysts and neutralizing gels for pesticides: How to eliminate and avoid intoxication?	The threat of intoxication by organophosphates - pesticides and chemical warfare - is a real concern worldwide. Fast, efficient and non-aggressive approaches for prevention and treatment are required. The use of functionalized biopolymers towards chemical neutralization of organophosphate is strategic since it is environmentally friendly. Herein, three carboxymethyl cellulose-derived biocatalysts were achieved via covalent functionalization with hydroxamates and imidazoles, targeted on the carboxylic acids of the cellulosic biopolymer. The aimed strategy was successful, confirmed by characterizations with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, potentiometric titration, thermogravimetric analysis, zeta potential titrations, size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle static light scattering, colorimetric test with iron (III) and rheological assays. The materials in colloidal form were highly reactive in the catalytic neutralization -evaluated by kinetic studies - with rate enhancements up to 10<sup>7</sup>-fold for the real-life Paraoxon, compared to the reaction in the absence of biocatalysts. Chemical selectivity towards the phosphorus center was accomplished - the desirable pathway that leads to less toxic products - and maintained the reactivity for at least 5 reaction cycles. Furthermore, the biocatalysts were processed as neutralizing gels aiming for skin intoxication prevention against organophosphates. Indeed, in vitro permeation assays evidenced that the gels eliminated 100 % of the toxic agent after 24 hours. The gels were able to destroy the organophosphates, whilst the phenolic degradation product was detected in assay. Thus, these results emphasize the potential of biocompatible polymeric materials as interesting platforms to anchor reactive groups to design catalytic materials aiming chemical decontamination and security.
39954133	Vinpocetine and Lactobacillus Attenuated Rotenone-Induced Parkinson's Disease and Restored Dopamine Synthesis in Rats through Modulation of Oxidative Stress, Neuroinflammation, and Lewy Bodies Inclusion.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the main neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor activity, there are different pathophysiological pathways contributing to its development including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, Lewy's bodies accumulation, and impaired autophagy. Vinpocetine is an herbal extract with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities that may counteract pathophysiologic neurodegeneration pathways. Moreover, Lactobacillus is a probiotic that can modulate the gut-brain axis and provide the body with the needed precursors of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory mediators. In the current study PD was induced experimentally in Sprague Dawley rats with rotenone (2.5 mg/kg, i.p, daily) for 60 days, vinpocetine; Vinpo (20 mg/kg, orally, daily) and Lactobacillus; Lacto (2.7 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml, orally, daily) were applied as protective treatment. Vinpocetine and Lactobacillus treatment significantly ameliorated motor function by increasing distance traveled and rearing frequency in the open field test with a concomitant increase in falling time from both the accelerating rotarod and the wire screen test. Moreover, vinpocetine and Lactobacillus treatment upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase expression (the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis), leading to enhanced dopamine synthesis and improved dopaminergic function with regression of histopathological hallmarks. Antioxidant GSH levels were significantly increased after vinpocetine and Lactobacillus treatment with a significant decrease in MDA content in brain homogenates. Furthermore, vinpocetine and Lactobacillus treatment significantly decreased striatal inflammatory markers; nitrite, IL-1β and TNF-α. Proteinopathies were regressed with a substantial decrease in striatal α-synuclein and tau content. In conclusion, vinpocetine and Lactobacillus treatment reduced rotenone neurotoxicity with improved dopamine release and motor activity with correction of oxidative burden, neuro-inflammation, and proteinopathy.
39953887	Mapping commercial practices of the pesticide industry to shape science and policymaking: a scoping review.	There is a growing body of evidence for how health harming industries (HHIs) engage in similar practices to influence science and policymaking. However, limited attention has been paid to the pesticide industry within the commercial determinants of health (CDOH) field. We conducted a scoping review to map practices adopted by the pesticide industry to influence science and policymaking and to assess the breadth and focus of the associated literature. We included 31 documents and categorized the extracted data using a typology of commercial practices. The documents described how major pesticide companies, and their trade bodies, have acted to influence science and maintain favourable regulatory environments while undermining the credibility of researchers and agencies that publish findings threatening to their commercial interests. A large proportion of the literature consists of historical analyses, narrative reviews, commentaries/perspective pieces, and investigative reports published in the grey literature, predominantly informed by analysis of internal industry documents and freedom of information requests. Most studies focus on high-income settings. There were a limited number of primary peer-reviewed empirical studies that explicitly aimed to study the practices of the pesticide industry from a CDOH perspective. However, our findings show that major pesticide companies adopt political and scientific practices highly similar to other HHIs. The review shows a critical need for research on the pesticide industry's current practices in low- and middle-income countries where the negative impacts of its activities on health and the environment are likely to be more marked.
39953835	Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex recruits retromer to trans-Golgi network for FgKex2 and FgSnc1 recycling, necessary for the development and pathogenicity of Fusarium graminearum.	In eukaryotes, the retromer complex plays a crucial role in the sorting and retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Despite its importance, the molecular details of this intracellular transport process remain unclear. Here, we have identified a Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex as a mediator of vesicle transport that facilitates the recruitment of the retromer complex to the TGN to exert its functions. The GARP complex is mainly localized in the TGN where it interacts with the retromer complex. This interaction is evolutionarily conserved across species. Furthermore, we identified FgKex2 and FgSnc1 as cargo proteins in the GARP/retromer-mediated recycling pathway. Loss of GARP or retromer results in a complete missorting of FgKex2 and FgSnc1 into the vacuolar degradation pathway, which affects the growth, development, biogenesis of toxisomes and pathogenicity of Fusarium graminearum. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that GARP promotes the recruitment of retromer from endosomes to the TGN, thereby establishing a GARP/retromer transport pathway that coordinates the recycling of cargo proteins FgKex2 and FgSnc1. This process is essential for maintaining sustained growth and development and significantly contributes to the pathogenicity of F. graminearum.
39953466	Exploring the association between exposure to pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and phthalates and metabolic syndrome in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA, 2007-2012: utilizing a multi-step statistical strategy.	Pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and phthalates are recognized as potential contributors to metabolic disorders. Nevertheless, the combined effect of simultaneous exposure to these chemicals on the metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains elusive.
39953394	Bacillus paralicheniformis SYN-191 isolated from ginger rhizosphere soil and its growth-promoting effects in ginger farming.	The use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and the farming without crop rotation may negatively impact the microbial community and the quality of the soils in ginger farm. It is important to improve soil properties to promote the healthy growth of ginger in ginger farm.

39953098	Alleviating biotic stress of powdery mildew in mango cv. Keitt by Sulfur nanoparticles and assessing their effect on productivity and disease severity.	The control of powdery mildew disease is one of the main objectives in Mango production. Mango production with superior quality is becoming increasingly challenging due to climate change, which may negatively affect all stages of their development. Recently, Nanotechnology is a promising and rapidly evolving field that could be a very useful tool to raise the efficiency of fungicides. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of sulfur nanoparticles (SNPs) and reducing the incidence of powdery mildew, improving growth performance and productivity of mango cv. Keitt (Mangifera indica L.). Four concentrations of SNPs (0, 100, 300, and 500 ppm) were compared to sulfur microform (bulk) at a concentration of 500 ppm. At a private farm on Cairo Alex Desert Road K78, Egypt, foliar spray treatments were administered to an eight-year-old mango cv. Keitt grafted on Sukari rootstock. The experiment was conducted using a randomized complete block design, with each tree receiving a five-liter spray of the solution. The results suggested that the use of 500 ppm concentration of SNPs led to reducing powdery mildew disease incidence by 8.8% but it negatively affected productivity, as it decreased by 27% compared to the control treatment. Whereas 100 ppm concentration of SNPs led to increasing the productivity by 342% compared to the control treatment, reducing powdery mildew disease incidence in mango was recorded at 14.6%. Furthermore, the TSS and vitamin C increased significantly by 16 Brix and 46.3 mg, respectively, in association with decreasing titratable acidity in fruits. In aggregate, our data demonstrated that 100 ppm and 300 ppm of sulfur nanoparticles was more efficient than 500 ppm of sulfur bulk in improving POD and PPO enzyme activity. It is recommended to add SNPs of 100 ppm as foliar spraying three times at 15-day intervals for alleviating the harmful impact of disease on mango trees by improving the enzyme activity, thereby yield, and fruit quality of mango trees exposed to powdery mildew disease.
39952648	The larval gut of Spodoptera frugiperda harbours culturable bacteria with metabolic versatility after insecticide exposure.	Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) poses a substantial risk to crops worldwide, resulting in considerable economic damage. The gut microbiota of insects plays crucial roles in digestion, nutrition, immunity, growth and, sometimes, the degradation of insecticides. The current study examines the effect of synthetic insecticides on the gut microbiome of third instar S. frugiperda larvae using both culture-dependent techniques and 16S rRNA gene sequencing for bacterial community profiling and diversity analysis. In untreated larvae, the sequencing approach revealed a diverse microbiome dominated by the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota, with key genera including Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium and Pelomonas. In parallel, 323 bacterial strains were isolated and assigned to the orders Bacillales, Burkholderiales, Enterobacterales, Flavobacteriales, Lactobacillales, Micrococcales, Neisseriaies, Pseudomonadales, Sphingobacteriales and Xanthomonadales. The prevailing culturable species included Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella variicola and Enterobacter quasiroggenkampii. Treatment with sublethal concentrations of three insecticides (broflanilide, spinosad and indoxacarb) caused significant changes in gut microbiome diversity and composition. Treated larvae showed a shift towards increased Proteobacteria abundance and decreased Firmicutes. Specifically, Acinetobacter and Rhodococcus were dominant in treated samples. Functional predictions highlighted significant metabolic versatility involving nutrient processing, immune response, detoxification, xenobiotic metabolism, and stress response, suggesting microbial adaptation to insecticide exposure. Network correlation analysis highlighted disrupted microbial interactions and altered community structures under insecticide treatment. These findings enhance our understanding of how insecticides impact the gut microbiota in S. frugiperda and may inform future strategies for managing pest resistance through microbiome-based approaches.
39952594	The common kestrel as an environmental bioindicator of toxic chemicals on Tenerife Island (Canary Islands, Spain).	Indirect effects of toxic chemicals, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), affect non-target species like apex predators due to bioaccumulation in food webs. The common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus canariensis), an endemic subspecies from the Canary Islands and Madeira, was evaluated as a bioindicator to assess contamination by organic pollutants in Tenerife. A total of 390 liver samples, collected between 2003 and 2021, were analysed for 341 toxic compounds including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and POPs like PCBs, PBDEs, PAHs and OCPs. Results revealed widespread contamination: 97.7% of kestrels had DDE, and 94.6% had PCB, with congener #180 being the most prevalent. BDE-153 was detected in 32.3% of samples and PAH, predominantly naphthalene, in 36.9%. Additionally, we identified four fungicides, five insecticides, one herbicide, and the acaricide tetradifon, marking the first report of these substances in raptors globally. Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Linear Models (LM) indicated that adults had significantly higher levels of OCP and PCB, and PBDE exposure. Males exhibited significantly higher levels of PCBs and were more likely to be exposed to PBDEs. A decline in the concentrations and presence of OCPs, PCBs, and PBDEs was observed during the second study period (2003-2009 vs. 2017-2021). For PAHs, the null model was the best fit, indicating that the factors examined (sex, age, human density, cultivated area or period) did not have a significantly influence on exposure. This comprehensive, long-term study, represents a pioneering investigation in the Canary Islands, demonstrating the utility of the common kestrel as a bioindicator of environmental pollution.
39952590	Pollution dynamics in the first marine protected area of the Northwestern Arabian Gulf: Environmental assessment and management implications.	Coastal ecosystems, especially in rapidly industrializing regions, are increasingly threatened by pollution, necessitating the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to mitigate such impacts. In the environmentally challenged Northwestern Arabian Gulf (NWAG), the establishment of Sulaibikhat MPA in 2012 represents a critical step toward preserving vulnerable marine habitats. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of pollution stress in this MPA, focusing on microbial indicators, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and surfactants in seawater and sediment samples collected from October 2018 to March 2021. Microbial indicators, including total coliforms and Escherichia coli, were within acceptable limits, but sediment contamination with TPH (18.8-1339.7 ppm) far exceeded moderate pollution thresholds. PAH levels were low in seawater but elevated in sediments, revealing both pyrogenic and fresh petroleum contamination. Surfactant concentrations, particularly non-ionic types, exceeded toxicity thresholds for aquatic organisms, signaling significant ecological risk. Trace levels of banned persistent organic pollutants such as Endosulfan II and PCB 74, were detected after June 2019, suggesting ongoing pollution from agricultural and industrial sources. This study highlights the urgent need for targeted pollution control and sustainable management practices to preserve the ecological integrity of the NWAG MPA. The results serve as a baseline for future monitoring and policy formulation, crucial for safeguarding this key marine ecosystem in a region facing escalating environmental challenges.
39952587	Evaluation of the honeybee exposome in European apiaries by combining passive samplers and liquid chromatography with Zeno trap-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.	This study introduces an analytical methodology that combines passive sampling with ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with a high-end quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) for monitoring the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) exposome across various European regions and seasons. The sampling methodology employs the recently developed adsorb pesticide in-hive strips (APIStrip) passive samplers, which use TENAX® TA adsorbent, to collect a wide range of chemicals when placed inside beehives. Following acetonitrile-based desorption, extracts were analyzed by UHPLC-QTOF-MS, equipped with an advanced ion trap -the Zeno trap- that enhances tandem-mass spectrometry (MS/MS) signals and improves mass accuracy, facilitating efficient feature annotation. A non-targeted analysis (NTA) approach, combined with multivariate analysis, was used to simultaneously identify exposure analytes (e.g.natural products) and effect-related metabolites associated with honeybee health and condition (e.g. pheromones and other compounds emitted by bees). This methodology revealed geographical and seasonal variations in the chemical profiles of honeybee hives. In the evaluated Nordic countries, natural products from plants and pollen, along with bee-emitted substances such us neurotransmitters and pheromones, were prevalent. Seasonal analysis in Denmark revealed distinct chemical profiles associated with blooming flowers and peak brood rearing activity in April. This integrated, non-invasive methodology has proven highly effective in assessing the honeybee exposome, providing valuable insights into how environmental factors influence the chemical profiles emitted by bees.
39952347	Expression analysis of molecular chaperones associated with disaggregation complex in rotenone-induced Parkinsonian rat model.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the aberrant aggregation and phosphorylation (ser129) of α-synuclein (α-syn, a presynaptic protein) which leads to the formation of pathogenic Lewy bodies. A critical factor in the pathogenesis of PD is the disruption of the cellular protein quality control system, where molecular chaperones and their co-chaperones are integral for mitigating proteotoxic stress. Although the role of molecular chaperones in PD and other protein aggregation diseases has been extensively investigated, the in vivo investigation of disaggregation chaperones, including HSP70, HSP105, and co-chaperone DNAJBs, remains relatively limited. The present study aims to elucidate the expression dynamics of the disaggregation molecular chaperones within the substantia nigra pars compacta of the rotenone-induced Parkinsonian rat model and its association with α-syn aggregation. The rotenone-treated rats exhibited significant behavioural symptoms, α-syn aggregation and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, confirming the development of Parkinsonism. Significant upregulation of α-syn expression/phosphorylation and co-localization in TH+ve neurons in the SNpc of treated rats was observed. Further, the gene and protein analysis of HSP70, DNAJB6, and HSP105 were found to be upregulated and TH+ve neurons showed their co-localization with p-α-syn<sup>ser129</sup> expression. The total proteomic analysis of SNpc correlated the altered cellular processes with cellular homeostasis imbalance. The observations of the present study provide an in vivo analysis of disaggregation-associated molecular chaperones in Parkinsonian or α-syn related conditions. The study can be helpful for further manipulation in the expression or activity of disaggregation-related chaperones for advanced therapeutic strategies and mechanistic studies in protein aggregation-associated diseases.
39952205	Behavioral and physiological effects of difenoconazole on stingless bees: A multi-species analysis.	Stingless bees, vital to ecosystems and plant production, face increasing threats from pesticide use, with poorly understood potential impacts of fungicides on these pollinators. The goal of this work was to evaluate the effect of contact or oral exposure to difenoconazole, a broad-spectrum fungicide, on foragers of three species of stingless bees: Frieseomelitta varia, Melipona mondury, and Trigona spinipes. The study employed a field-realistic dose of difenoconazole (0.075 mg a.i./mL, referred to as 1×) and its dilutions (10× or 100×) to assess survival and food consumption. The recommended field dose was used to evaluate behaviors, as well as total hemocyte count (THC), and midgut morphology. Contact or oral exposure increased THC in F. varia, while oral exposure decreased food consumed, distance walked, and social interactions, and caused injuries to the midgut. In M. mondury, contact exposure decreased survival and THC while increasing interactions, whereas oral exposure increased walking distance and interactions. For T. spinipes, contact exposure increased walking distance and interactions. Exposures caused adverse effects with variations in the level or type of damage depending on the species and route of exposure. This emphasizes the significance of understanding the potential impacts of fungicides on various pollinators, particularly on stingless bees.
39952180	Determination of glyphosate with a novel optic membrane sensor.	Glyphosate has been a widely used herbicide since the 1970s. However, glyphosate causes serious health problems if exposed to it for a long time. Therefore, quick and reliable determination of glyphosate becomes an important issue. This study proposes a solution to this issue with a highly selective and sensitive fluorescent polymeric membrane sensor for glyphosate determination with a wide linear working range (1-18 ppb) and low detection limit (0.84 ppb). The developed sensor can measure glyphosate at pH 8.0 and is applicable to real samples with recovery percentages varying between 98.4 and 111.5. Additionally, this sensor can respond in a short time and can be reused up to 200 times. The repeatability of the method was found to be 10.47 ± 0.11 at a 95 % confidence level and the relative standard deviation was 1.76 for the analysis results of 10 ppb samples. All these features make proposed method, an ambitious alternative tool for glyphosate detection.
39952123	Broad-specificity and ultrasensitive immunochromatographic detection of bentazone and its metabolites using computer-aided hapten screening.	Bentazone (Ben) is a benzothiadiazole herbicide, and its widespread use can lead to excessive residues in crop products, polluting environmental water and soil. Ben and its metabolites 6-hydroxybentazone, 8-hydroxybentazone, and Bentazone methyl are all toxic to human, therefore it's crucial to detect Ben and metabolites. In this study, the epitope information of Ben was analyzed from molecular space conformation and electrostatic potential distribution. Three novel haptens were prepared by designing and modifying the benzene ring, imine, and carbonyl groups of Ben molecule. The matrix effect enhancement screening method was used to obtain high affinity and broad-spectrum monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The co-monitoring of Ben and its metabolites could be realized at one time, different from other detection methods. The IC50 values of mAbs against Ben was 1.70 ng/mL. The colloidal gold immunochromatography was firstly developed to detect Ben in lake water, soil, and French bean samples with LOD of 1.47 ng/g, 1.54 ng/g, and 4.83 ng/g, respectively, and detection ranges of 2.52-22.71 ng/g, 2.64-139.73 ng/g, and 8.31-49.36 ng/g, respectively. The recovery rate was 88.5 %-99.5 %, and confirmed by positive Ben samples. The CGIA exhibited excellent detection performance for on-site detection of Ben and metabolites in environmental samples.
39952084	Pyraclostrobin-induced toxic effects in the gills of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.): Mechanisms unveiled through biochemical, molecular, and metabolomic analyses.	Pyraclostrobin (PYR) is widely used in agriculture to control fungal infestations. However, the toxic effects of PYR on aquatic organisms remain poorly understood. In this study, common carp were exposed to 0.5, and 5.0 μg/L PYR for 30 days to evaluate the chronic effects on gill health via histopathological, biochemical, molecular, and metabolomic analyses. The findings revealed that exposure to PYR resulted in significant histopathological alterations, suppression of mitochondrial complex III activity, and excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, PYR exposure altered the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) while increasing the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the gills of common carp. The protein expression levels of lysozyme (LZM), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) were significantly elevated following exposure to PYR, whereas the levels of complement 3 (C3) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were decreased. Furthermore, the amount of IL-6 decreased on day 15 before increasing on day 30. Further analysis revealed a notable increase in acid phosphatase (ACP) activity and a decrease in alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity after 30 days of PYR exposure. Moreover, PYR exposure significantly altered the mRNA expression levels of immune-related genes (lzm, c3, and igm) and apoptosis-related genes (p53, bcl-2, bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9). Several inflammatory markers, such as NF-κB p65 protein and the mRNA levels of tlr2, tlr4, myd88, tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, and tgf-β, were also markedly changed. Metabolomic studies demonstrated that PYR influences pathways related to amino acid, nucleotide, arachidonic acid, and linoleic acid metabolism. These results indicate that PYR adversely affects gill health by inducing oxidative stress, disrupting immune and inflammatory responses, affecting apoptosis-related pathways, and altering metabolic homeostasis. This study provides new insights into the toxic mechanisms of PYR and contributes to the assessment of the ecological risks associated with its presence in aquatic ecosystems.
39951948	Impacts of neonicotinoid compounds on the structure and function of Apis mellifera OBP14: Insights from SPR, ITC, multispectroscopy, and molecular modeling.	Honeybees are vital for biodiversity and agricultural productivity, yet their populations are declining globally, partly due to exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides. Odorant-binding protein 14 (OBP14) plays an important role in honeybee chemosensation, but its involvement in neonicotinoid toxicity remains underexplored due to limitations in traditional fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. This gap hampers our understanding of neonicotinoid risks to honeybee health. Here, we explored the molecular interactions between OBP14 from Apis mellifera and three widely used neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin) using molecular modeling, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and multispectroscopy. SPR and ITC characterized the binding affinity, specificity, and thermodynamic parameters of AmelOBP14 interacting with three neonicotinoid compounds, revealing that the binding process is spontaneous and primarily driven by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Molecular modeling highlighted that phenylalanine residue Phe54, near the binding site, plays a critical role in these interactions. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) support slight changes in the microenvironment around the aromatic amino acids of OBP14. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) indicate a decrease in the α-helix content of OBP14, suggesting a change in its secondary structure, while three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence spectroscopy confirms the non-fluorescent nature of the OBP14 polypeptide backbone. The study results revealed its potential as a biomarker for pesticide risk assessment, providing important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which neonicotinoids may impair bee chemosensory function, and offering guidance for the design of safer pesticides to minimize harm to these important pollinators.
39951946	Defining region-specific soil quality standards for pesticides in China.	China is a vast, pesticide-dependent agricultural country. Given that pesticide exposure patterns and dissipation vary across regions, there is a need to establish region-specific soil pesticide standards to protect human health. This study proposed a regulatory framework that can derive pesticide soil standards (PSSs) for the average (PSS<sub>A</sub>) and ceiling (PSS<sub>C</sub>) values. This framework consists of two components: human exposure assessment and pesticide dissipation. The former computes the region-specific exposure frequency and duration of the children and provides a comprehensive health risk assessment to derive PSS<sub>A</sub>. The latter calculates the region-specific pesticide dissipation and pesticide application intervals and determines the relationship between average and ceiling concentration after pesticide application to derive PSS<sub>C</sub>. Employing this framework, a spreadsheet-based simulation tool was developed to calculate standards for the four most widely used pesticides in China. The results showed that the simulated PSS<sub>A</sub> values of acetochlor, atrazine, carbofuran, and chlorpyrifos varied considerably among different provinces, ranging from 33.3-121.6, 300.7-683.4, 1.9-5.1, and 10.1-33.9 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Children in the southern provinces tended to have longer outdoor activity time (i.e., higher outdoor soil exposure frequency) than in the northern provinces due to the warm weather, hence these regions require stricter (i.e., lower) average soil standards. Pesticide dissipation rates in the northern provinces were slower than in the southern provinces. Nevertheless, due to the higher frequency of pesticide applications in the southern regions, the PSS<sub>C</sub> values in these areas are still generally lower than in the northern regions. In addition, a comparison was conducted between the current standards and simulated values for 13 regulated pesticides. The results found that there is a lack of ceiling standards in China to manage pesticide application patterns and the existing standards for some pesticides (e.g., chlordane, HCB, and lindane) may be too lenient for certain southern provinces to protect human health. Taken together, it is recommended that China's environmental agencies update the pesticide standard system. The regulatory framework and simulation tool proposed in this study are expected to provide scientific and reasonable support for establishing region-specific standards.
39951945	Influencing factors on performance of electro-oxidation and UV/electro-oxidation for removal of atrazine: Kinetics, long-term stability and toxicity.	Performance of electro-oxidation (EO) and UV/electro-oxidation (UV/EO) on atrazine (ATZ) removal was investigated under various operating factors. Because of synergistic effect on ATZ removal, UV/EO was the most effective process, followed by UV/chlorine, EO, UV irradiation, and chlorination, respectively. Although the energy consumption of UV/EO for 90% removal was similar to that of EO, UV/EO removed ATZ 1.8 times faster than EO. Boron doped diamond (BDD) exhibited greater ATZ removal than dimensionally stable anode (DSA), and performance of BDD was stable for treatment of 50 cycle times (100 h). Performance of EO and UV/EO on ATZ removal increased with higher current density and low pH. ATZ removal by EO and UV/EO was independent to NaCl concentrations (300-1000 mg.L<sup>-1</sup>). HO• played a major role on ATZ removal, while the role of RCS was minor. The 2nd-order reaction rate constant of HO• with ATZ (k<sub>ATZ-HO•</sub>) was 1.36 × 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. Although phytotoxicity was a sensitive endpoint to ATZ, different inhibition on germination of Ipomoea aquatica and Oryza sativa L. (Khao Dawk Mali 105) seeds was observed. UV/EO was the most effective process for ATZ detoxication. Germination index of Ipomoea aquatica and Oryza sativa L. (Khao Dawk Mali 105) seeds for samples treated by UV/EO was equivalent or greater than the control sample.
39951409	Energy-environmental evaluation of conventional and variable rate technology sprayer; application of Life Cycle Assessment.	The objective of this research was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the energy and environmental efficiency of a smart sprayer with a variable rate in orange production. The smart sprayer was developed from a standard orchard sprayer with a fixed rate using different equipment. Energy indicators, encompassing energy efficiency, energy productivity, energy intensity and net energy gain, were calculated. Environmental indicators, including global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity potentials, were estimated using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method in 15 midpoint and 4 endpoint categories. The findings demonstrated that the smart sprayer with a variable rate held a significant advantage over the conventional sprayer with a fixed rate in terms of reducing the pesticide deposition on the trees, lowering pesticide consumption, increasing the energy efficiency and productivity and mitigating the environmental impacts. The maximum pesticide lowering was 46%, achieved at a speed of 1.6 km.hr-1. The energy efficiency and productivity changed from 0.594 to 0.650 and from 0.313 to 0.342 kg.MJ-1, respectively. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) declined from 422.860 to 407.573 kg CO2 eq per ton of orange production. The reduction of chemical pesticide, diesel fuel and agricultural machinery consumption contributed to the decrease in environmental emissions. Consequently, the smart sprayer with a variable rate emerged as a significantly more sustainable and efficient solution for orange production.
39951009	Amino Acids-Enabled Fast-Restore of Triplet-Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Luminescence for Background-Free Sensing of Herbicides.	Overuse of herbicides poses a serious threat to ecosystems and human health; thus, the accurate determination of herbicide residue is very meaningful. Thanks to the advantage of no background fluorescence interference, the upconversion luminescence allows for reliable analysis of target molecules in complicated samples. Here, through screening of 20 natural amino acids, it is discovered that the photooxidation of methionine exhibited the fastest recovery rate of triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) luminescence via oxygen consumption, which is 400-fold faster compared to the well-known photooxidation of oleic acid. Furthermore, oxygen-resistant, small-size, red-to-blue TTA-UC nanoparticles with a record upconversion efficiency (7.2%, normalized to 100%) are prepared using hydrophobic butyl methionine as an oxygen scavenger. Surface negatively charged TTA-UC nanoparticles are able to selectively enrich positively charged paraquat on their surface. Accordingly, a photoinduced electron transfer process occurred between the triplet excited state of the photosensitizer and the electron-deficient paraquat, quenching the upconversion luminescence. Relying on this principle, TTA-UC-based paraquat sensing is achieved with a fast response (less than 1 s), high selectivity, and a low limit of detection (1.54 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>). Further, the TTA-UC nanoparticles are utilized to implement paraquat analysis in lake water without sample pretreatment.
39950955	Study on the Mechanism of Benziothiazolinone and Its Synergistic Effect with Tebuconazole in Inhibiting <i>Fusarium asiaticum</i> and DON Production.	Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by the <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> species complex, is a devastating disease of wheat and other cereal crops. This study investigates the antifungal mechanism of the novel fungicide benziothiazolinone (BIT) against <i>Fusarium asiaticum</i> (Fa) and its synergistic effect with tebuconazole (TB). BIT could inhibit NADH and ATP production and lead to mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby inhibiting the mycelial growth of Fa. Besides, BIT mixing with TB at 1:1 showed an obvious synergistic effect against Fa based on mycelial growth and could significantly inhibit reactive oxygen species and DON productions, toxisome formation, as well as the expression of DON biosynthesis-related genes <i>tri1</i>, <i>tri5</i>, and <i>tri6</i>. In addition, field experiments showed that BIT mixing with TB exhibited 77.63% efficacy in FHB control and 51.92% efficacy in DON contamination. Taken together, this study highlights the synergistic effects of BIT and TB in FHB control and toxin management.
39950633	Discovery of Novel <i>N</i>-Phenylphthalimide Protoporphyrinogen IX Oxidase Inhibitors.	Developing new compounds with improved bioactivity is a crucial objective in herbicide research. To discover new compounds with high biological activity, a series of <i>N</i>-phenylphthalimide derivatives containing ether and oxime ether moieties were designed and synthesized. The assays demonstrated significant inhibitory effects of certain compounds on <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> PPO (<i>Nt</i>PPO). Among them, compound <b>A4</b> exhibited the most potent inhibition of <i>Nt</i>PPO, with a <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> value of 9.05 nM, surpassing both flumioxazin (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 52.0 nM) and flumiclorac-pentyl (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 46.3 nM). In addition, compound <b>A4</b> exhibited complete inhibition against six weed species (<i>Setaria viridis</i>, <i>Echinochloa crus-galli</i>, <i>Digitaria sanguinalis</i>, <i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i>, <i>Abutilon theophrasti</i>, and <i>Portulaca oleracea</i>) and caused only 30-50% damage to maize and rice at 150 g a.i./ha. Molecular simulation analysis demonstrated that compound <b>A4</b> exhibited stable binding to <i>Nt</i>PPO due to the formation of a strong hydrogen bond with Arg98 (2.8 Å), surpassing the interactions of flumiclorac-pentyl (3.2 Å) and flumioxazin (3.1 Å). These findings suggest that compound <b>A4</b> holds potential as a novel PPO inhibitor for the management of agricultural weeds.
39950610	Impact of genetically modified herbicide-resistant maize on rhizosphere bacterial communities.	Rhizosphere bacterial community studies offer valuable insights into the environmental implications of genetically modified (GM) crops. This study compared the effects of a non-GM maize cultivar, namely Hi-IIA, with those of a herbicide-resistant maize cultivar containing the <i>phosphinothricin N-acetyltransferase</i> gene on the rhizosphere bacterial community across growth stages. 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing and data analysis tools revealed no significant differences in bacterial community composition or diversity between the cultivars. Principal component analysis revealed that differences in community structure were driven by plant growth stages rather than plant type. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was conducted to examine the potential horizontal transfer of the introduced gene from the GM maize to rhizosphere microorganisms; however, the introduced gene was not detected in the soil genomic DNA. Overall, the environmental impact of GM maize, particularly on soil microorganisms, is negligible, and the cultivation of GM maize does not alter significantly the rhizosphere bacterial community.
39950313	Direct Oral Anticoagulants Compared With Warfarin in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Valvular Heart Disease Without Mechanical Valves.	Despite proven efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), data on patients with AF and valvular heart disease remain scarce. We aimed to evaluate the DOACs compared with warfarin among patients with AF and valvular heart disease.
39950282	Ameliorating Paraquat-Induced Nephrotoxicity in Rats: Protective Effects of Nanocurcumin on Renal Histology and Molecular Pathways.	Paraquat (PQ) is a common herbicide, and its mortality results from injury to several organs, including the kidneys. Nanocurcumin and curcumin have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities, but their involvement in PQ-induced kidney damage is unclear. Therefore, the goal of our study was to compare nanocurcumin and curcumin in male rats whose kidneys were damaged by PQ.
39949897	Indoor Residual Spraying With Fludora Fusion for Malaria Control in Pyrethroid-Resistant Areas of Gujarat, India: A Community-Randomized Trial.	<b>Background:</b> The development of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has necessitated a need to evaluate new insecticide molecules with different modes of action. In the present study, Fludora Fusion 562.5 WP-SB (clothianidin 50% + deltamethrin 6.25% AI/kg) was evaluated for its efficacy and residual action for the control of pyrethroid-resistant malaria vector, <i>Anopheles culicifacies</i> (Diptera: Culicidae), during May 2017 to February 2018 in Gujarat state, India. <b>Methods:</b> Fludora Fusion at the dose of 225 mg AI/m<sup>2</sup> and bendiocarb at a dose of 400 mg AI/m<sup>2</sup> as a positive control were sprayed in 5 villages each in districts of Kheda, Vadodara, and Panchmahal. The persistence of their efficacy on different local surfaces was determined against <i>An. culicifacies</i>. Entomological indices such as indoor resting density, human landing collections, pyrethrum spray collections, and exit trap collections were monitored to assess the impact of spraying. <b>Results:</b> The observed residual action of Fludora Fusion on mud and cement surfaces was for 6 months and bendiocarb for 3-4 months on both surfaces. Indoor resting densities and parous rate of <i>An. culicifacies</i> were significantly lower in houses sprayed with Fludora Fusion compared to bendiocarb-sprayed houses. Daily entomological inoculation rate (EIR) declined from 1.275 during prespray period to 0.5225 in the Fludora Fusion arm and 0.3802 in the Ficam arm in postspray period, indicating a reduction in the malaria transmission potential of <i>An. culicifacies</i> in both arms. <b>Conclusion:</b> Based on the residual action of the Fludora Fusion on most common sprayed surfaces and its effects on the elements of vectorial capacity, Fludora Fusion at 225 mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose was found effective for more than 6 months and could be a potential option for the control of resistant mosquito vectors.
39949619	Genome-wide identification of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases genes and functional characterization of <i>ApSDR53C2</i> in melanin biosynthesis in <i>Arthrinium phaeospermum</i>.	<i>Arthrinium phaeospermum</i> can cause large areas wilted and death of <i>Bambusa pervariabilis</i> × <i>Dendrocalamopsis grandis</i>, resulting in serious ecological and economic losses. Previous studies found that the appressorium of <i>A. phaeospermum</i> must form to invade the host cells and cause disease. A short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase gene has been shown to maintain the osmotic pressure of the appressorium by synthesizing fungal melanin to penetrate the plant epidermis and cause disease. The SDR gene family of <i>A. phaeospermum</i> was found to be highly expressed during the penetration in the transcriptome sequencing results. Still, the relationship with melanin biosynthesis of <i>A. phaeospermum</i> is not clear.
39949148	Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of oxime ether derivatives containing 1,5-dimethyl-6-thioxo-1,3,5-triazinane-2,4-dione as protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase inhibitors.	Herbicides based on protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (PPO; EC 1.3.3.4) are widely used for weeding control in agricultural fields to safeguard food security. PPO herbicides, because of their low dosage, rapid action on weeds, slow accumulation in the environment and low toxicity to mammals, have become an important field of research in the development of new herbicides. This study presents a novel molecular scaffold with remarkably potent herbicidal activity.
39949049	Could Flumazenil Be Used Pre-hospital by Intramuscular Injection for Coma due to Mixed Drug Overdose Not Responding to Naloxone?: A Systematic Review of the Evidence.	Benzodiazepine-involved overdose deaths are increasing. Flumazenil is rarely used due to fear of seizures; however, the risk benefit may favour its use. Flumazenil is licensed for intravenous (IV) use, but intramuscular (IM) treatment would be required pre-hospital.
39948689	Negative impacts of insecticide-treated methods and slot traps for trapping of Ips cembrae on nontarget invertebrates.	Ips cembrae is serious forest pest of European larch (Larix decidua). The negative impacts on nontarget invertebrates of the use of different I. cembrae trapping methods has not yet been evaluated, although mortality of nontarget invertebrates may occur.
39948562	Determination of the residual efficacy of broflanilide (VECTRON™ T500) insecticide for indoor residual spraying in a semi-field setting in Ethiopia.	The rotational use of insecticides with diverse modes of action in indoor residual spraying (IRS) is pivotal for enhancing malaria vector control and addressing insecticide resistance. A key factor in national malaria vector control/elimination programmes is the rate at which these insecticides decay. VECTRON™ T500, with broflanilide as its active ingredient, is a recently developed candidate insecticide formulation which has shown promising results in certain phase II experimental hut trials. However, its residual efficacy across different settings has not been thoroughly investigated. This study evaluated the efficacy of VECTRON™ T500 on various wall surfaces (mud, dung, paint, and cement) and assessed its decay rates over time in Ethiopia.
39948065	Pesticides have negative effects on non-target organisms.	Pesticides affect a diverse range of non-target species and may be linked to global biodiversity loss. The magnitude of this hazard remains only partially understood. We present a synthesis of pesticide (insecticide, herbicide and fungicide) impacts on multiple non-target organisms across trophic levels based on 20,212 effect sizes from 1,705 studies. For non-target plants, animals (invertebrate and vertebrates) and microorganisms (bacteria and fungi), we show negative responses of the growth, reproduction, behaviour and other physiological biomarkers within terrestrial and aquatic systems. Pesticides formulated for specific taxa negatively affected non-target groups, e.g. insecticidal neonicotinoids affecting amphibians. Negative effects were more pronounced in temperate than tropical regions but were consistent between aquatic and terrestrial environments, even after correcting for field-realistic terrestrial and environmentally relevant exposure scenarios. Our results question the sustainability of current pesticide use and support the need for enhanced risk assessments to reduce risks to biodiversity and ecosystems.
39948051	New Insights into Expanding the Insecticidal Spectrum of dsRNA Mediated by the High Sequence Identity between dsRNA and Nontarget mRNA.	RNA interference (RNAi) is being used to develop methods to control pests, yet its widespread application is limited by the high comprehensive application cost of dsRNAs. Here, we utilized the high identity matching between double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and nontarget genes to achieve expanding the dsRNA insecticidal spectrum. First, we found that dsRNA was more likely to induce off-target effects in genes with higher transcript levels and higher sequence identity; the existence of either a completely contiguous matching sequence exceeding 15 nt or a partially contiguous matching sequence of 24 nt between genes can lead to off-target effects in <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>. Accordingly, we successfully interfered with <i>T. castaneum</i> and <i>Laodelphax striatellus</i> using dsRNA targeted against <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>. Additionally, the use of dsRNA targeting <i>L. striatellus</i> effectively interfered with <i>N. lugens</i>, both instances resulting in lethal effects. Moreover, the dsRNA spray method proved to be more efficient than the rice seedling soaking method to deliver dsRNA. Our research offers new insights into expanding the insecticidal spectrum of dsRNA mediated by a high degree of sequence identity between genes.
39947798	Graphene oxide functionalized with hydrophilic ionic liquid as stir bar coating: Sorptive extraction of selected triazines in grape juice samples.	Sample preparation is essential for reducing matrix compound effects, increasing analytical method efficiency, and enhancing the detection of target compounds. Miniaturized techniques are preferred over conventional methods, due to their alignment with green analytical chemistry principles, reducing waste and offering comparable efficiency. The effectiveness of extraction techniques based on the use of sorbents depends on sorbent-analyte interactions, driving the search for more selective and versatile materials. Graphene oxide is noted for its high surface area, conjugated structure, and potential for functionalization, improving its adsorption capacity and modifying its polarity.
39947697	Assessment of Anticancer and Antimicrobial Potential of Bioactive Metabolites and Optimization of Culture Conditions of <i>Pseudomonas aurantiaca</i> PB-St2 for High Yields.	The following study aimed to characterize the biological potential of the purified compounds of <i>Pseudomonas aurantiaca</i> PB-St2. Optimization of temperature and incubation time of 32oC and 72 h yielded the highest crude extract weight and optical density of bacterial culture. HPLC analysis of the crude metabolite extract (purified using gravitational column chromatography) showed three fractions named as PC1, PC2, and PC3. HPLC-purified fractions were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis and the data was compared using reference library. Fraction PC1 was identified as mupirocin, PC2 as phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), and PC3 as the mixture of three compounds including pyoluteorin, PCA and 2-hydroxyphenazine (2-OH-phz). Fungicidal potential of the purified compounds was assessed against phytopathogens including <i>Fusarium equiseti</i>, <i>Fusarium incarnatum</i>, <i>Alternaria alternata</i>, and <i>Colletotrichum falcatum</i>. Fraction PC3 showed the highest fungicidal activity of ~89%, whereas, the least antifungal activity (~27%) was noted for mupirocin. Antibacterial activity of the purified compounds against Gram-positive pathogen <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, and Gram-negative pathogens <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Salmonella enterica</i>, and <i>Klebsiella oxytoca</i> was also assessed. Fraction PC3 demonstrated the highest antibacterial activity against <i>B. cereus</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> showing 1.8 cm, and 0.9 cm zones of inhibition, respectively. Against <i>K. oxytoca</i> and <i>S. enterica</i>, the antibacterial activity of PB-St2 crude extract was slightly higher than the fraction PC3. The fraction PC3 also demonstrated the highest IC<sub>50</sub> against HepG-2 and SF767 cancer cell lines at 25 μg and 20 μg concentrations, respectively. The multifaceted attributes of <i>P. aurantiaca</i> PB-St2 make it an ideal candidate for agricultural and pharmacological applications.
39947514	The flavouring agent, 2-octenoic acid kills Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) by affecting their immunocompetent cells and cuticular FFA profiles.	This study investigates the effects of the naturally occurring flavouring agent, trans-2-octenoic acid, on the insect model Galleria mellonella by examining its impact on immunocompetent cells and free fatty acid (FFA) profiles in the cuticle. The value of LD50 for 2-octenoic acid has been calculated as 9.66 µg/mg of insect body mass, this value is outside the GHS scale, indicating that the compound is unlikely to cause acute toxicity after dermal application and is safe for humans and mammals. Thetreatment with 2-octenoic acid caused several changes in the insect defence mechanismes, viz. changes in cuticular FFA profiles and death of immunocompetent cells. In larvae, topical treatment of 2-octenoic acid increased the concentration of cuticular FFAs, particularly C6:0 (245 times higher), C15:0 (110 times higher), and C16:1 (1608 times higher), and 2-octenoic acid (C8:1) accumulated significantly on the surface of the cuticle. In adults, treatment resulted in lower cuticular C8:1concentrations than in larvae, which might indicate that 2-octenoic acid penetrates more effectively through the adult cuticle. The 2-octenoic acid application demonstrated considerable cytotoxicity against insect cell line Sf9 and G. mellonella hemocytes, with both in vivo and in vitro treatment. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of how synthetic and naturally occurring chemicals may interact with the immune and physiological systems of insects, particularly focusing on G. mellonella as a model organism for toxicological studies. Given the increasing interest in the ecological and physiological impacts of food additives, our research provides novel insights into the biological interactions of 2-octenoic acid and its potential role as an insecticide.
39947384	The droplet and atmospheric dispersion drift (DAD-drift) model - A modular approach for estimating spray drift at the landscape scale.	Spray drift describes the off-target movement of pesticides by wind during or immediately after application, and its mechanism is highly complex and influenced by many factors. Spray drift modeling has become an increasingly important tool as spray drift field experiments are very expensive to conduct. Many modeling approaches are available to describe spray drift deposition after aerial and ground application at the field scale. We have developed a novel modeling approach to predict spray drift deposition after ground application at the landscape scale. The Droplet and Atmospheric Dispersion drift (DAD-drift) model combines a mechanistic droplet model, a micrometeorological model, and a three-dimensional Gaussian diffusion model. It is an iteration of the two-dimensional tilting plume approach and allows for the prediction of spray drift deposition from ground spray applications while accounting for environmental conditions, spray nozzle characteristics, and spray application characteristics. The DAD-drift model was evaluated against two field trial studies for a wide range of environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, humidity, wind speed) and four spray nozzles (fine to ultra-coarse). Model predictions were in very good agreement (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.931, RSR = 0.260) with spray drift observations from these studies, demonstrating the applicability of the model over a wide range of conditions. During a one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis, the model showed clear and understandable behavior when input parameters were varied. Droplet size distribution, boom height, temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric turbulence were identified as the most important factors.
39947321	Development of dual disease resistant Basmati rice varieties offer significant economic advantage and impetus to sustainable crop production.	Bacterial blight and blast are the major diseases causing production losses to an extent of 31.52% to 67.79%, respectively. Use of chemical pesticides leads to increased cost of cultivation, degradation of environment and human health while affecting international trade.
39947222	Ancient Egyptian Mummified Bodies: Cross-Disciplinary Analysis of Their Smell.	Ancient Egyptian mummification was a mortuary practice aimed at preserving the body and soul for the afterlife, achieved through a detailed ritual of embalming using oils, waxes, and balms. While most research on Egyptian mummified bodies has so far been conducted in European collections, our study focuses on the collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The goal was to evaluate whether contemporary smells reflect the mummification materials and, if so, what information can be of value to collection interpretation and conservation. We combined panel-based sensory analyses with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O), microbiological analysis, and historical and conservation research. Apart from differences in odor intensity, the sensory analyses highlighted common olfactory descriptors for all samples: "woody", "spicy", and "sweet". GC-MS-O identified four categories of volatiles based on their origin: (i) original mummification materials; (ii) plant oils used for conservation; (iii) synthetic pesticides; and (iv) microbiological deterioration products. However, the use of insect repellents similar in composition to the original mummification materials makes it challenging to attribute the origin of some compounds. Clusters based on the chemical and olfactory profiles of the smells emerged, suggesting similarities based on the archeological period, conservation treatments, and materiality.
39947078	Nanoplastics enhance tebuconazole toxicity in lettuce by promoting its accumulation and disrupting phenylalanine metabolism: Importance of Trojan horse effect.	Nanoplastics (NPs) are ubiquitous in agricultural environments and may exacerbate environmental risks of pesticides. This study investigates how NPs influence the toxicity of tebuconazole in lettuce. In a hydroponic model, NPs (10 and 50 mg/L) enhanced tebuconazole accumulation in roots and exacerbated its toxicity. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, a combination of in vivo, in vitro, and in silico models was employed. The results indicated that NPs were taken up by roots through apoplast pathway, predominantly accumulating in roots (35.6-40.7 %) due to aggregation in root sap and adhesion to cell wall. Tebuconazole adsorbs onto NPs with a high adsorption capacity (123.7 mg/g), enabling NPs to serve as carriers that facilitate tebuconazole entry into roots. Once in the root sap, tebuconazole desorbed from NPs and accumulated in cell walls, leading to higher residue in the roots (7.19-9.85 mg/kg). Furthermore, tebuconazole bound to key proteins involved in auxin biosynthesis (e.g., YUC) and signaling (e.g., TIR), thereby inhibiting tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathway and disrupting TIR1/AFB-mediated auxin signaling. Additionally, tebuconazole suppressed the phenylalanine pathway, reducing antioxidant secondary metabolites such as flavonols. When NPs are present, co-exposure intensified the inhibition of auxin and phenylalanine pathways, thereby amplifying the toxicity of tebuconazole, as evidenced by impaired plant phenotypes (e.g., biomass, root tips) and disrupted antioxidant systems. This study reveals threats posed by NPs and tebuconazole in agricultural systems and highlights the novel carrier effect of NPs in enhancing tebuconazole toxicity, emphasizing the urgent need to assess the fate and toxicity of NPs and coexisting pollutants.
39946927	Deposition, dissipation, metabolism and honey bee exposure risk of thiacloprid in greenhouse scenario.	The degradation and non-target risks of neonicotinoids under greenhouse scenarios remain poorly understood. Thiacloprid' deposition, dissipation, metabolism and honey bee exposure risk on greenhouse-grown cowpea, cucumber and melon were analyzed using a rapid detection method for thiacloprid and five metabolites. The initial concentration ratios and half-lives in plant tissues were highest in leaves (67.8 % and 3.13 days), followed by flowers (19.8 % and 1.17 days), stems (9.2 % and 2.07 days) and fruits (3.1 % and 2.40 days). Except for flower part, cowpea exhibited the most robust initial deposition values-1.40, 13.54, and 1.06 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (stem, leaf, fruit)-outstripping other crops corresponding tissues by a staggering 1.18-15.20 times. In the 12-24 h following application, a surge in thiacloprid content within the fruits of cowpea, cucumber, and muskmelon was observed, escalating by 31.6 % (0.33 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), 46.0 % (0.13 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and 105.4 % (0.07 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), respectively. In addition to M31, four thiacloprid metabolites were identified, with peak concentrations occurring in 1-7 days. Metabolite concentration ratios were highest in fruits (33.9 %), followed by leaves (26.9 %), stems (24.3 %), and flowers (14.9 %). 20.3 % of the time and space sampling was higher than the exposure risk concern value (HQ > 50), and 46.43 % was higher than the oral risk concern value (HQ > 50). Leaves and flowers were identified as high-risk tissues, requiring 2-20 days to reach low-risk levels for pollinator exposure. The research provides insights into the environmental behavior of neonicotinoids and the associated risks to pollinating bees in greenhouse scenarios.
39946901	Chronic toxicity of tetraconazole and penconazole to Daphnia magna: Insights of growth, reproduction and gene expression changes.	Tetraconazole and penconazole are widely used fungicides belonging to the conazole family. Due to the increasing use of these fungicides, their concentrations in aquatic environments are increasing and imply a serious threat to aquatic organisms. However, no studies have investigated the effects of tetraconazole and penconazole on aquatic invertebrates. This study examined for the first time, changes in growth, reproduction, and survival rate as well as changes in the expression of genes related to detoxification (HR96, P-GP, CYP360A8, GST) and reproduction (CUT, CYP314, DMRT, VTG) in D. magna after exposed to different tetraconazole and penconazole concentrations for 21 days. The 48-h EC<sub>50</sub> value was 12.35 μg/L for tetraconazole and 326.8 μg/L for penconazole. Chronic toxicity results showed that exposure to varying concentrations of tetraconazole and penconazole decreased body length, total offspring per female, molting frequency, heartbeat rate per minute, and survival rate, and increased day to the first brood in D. magna. The expression of genes related to detoxification and reproduction changed depending on the fungicide type and concentration. In general, transcription of genes related to detoxification was more affected by fungicides. The results revealed that tetraconazole and penconazole caused toxicity in D. magna by inhibiting growth and reproduction and affecting detoxification pathways similarly.
39946889	Reshuffling the risk values of pesticides in surface-groundwater systems: Evidence from mining intensity and hydrogeological vulnerabilities.	The extensive application of pesticides in agricultural cultivation and crop maintenance has resulted in their widespread occurrence and accumulation across diverse environmental media. This study screened >52 target pesticides occurs in both surface and groundwater, including 16 carbamates, 8 triazines, 6 triazoles, 4 chloroacetanilides, 3 neonicotinoids, 3 pyrazoles, 2 morpholines, and 10 other types of pesticides within the Wulong River Basin, situated on the Shandong Peninsula in China. The target pesticides in surface water ranged from below the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 111.2 ng/L, whereas in groundwater, they ranged from below LOQ to 148.1 ng/L. 63 % (p < 0.05) of the target pesticides follow the migration rule, where the concentration in surface water appears exceeded groundwater. 37 % overcome the pesticide properties and aquifer intrinsic vulnerability and show higher values in groundwater. The risk quotient values for imidacloprid and atrazine exceeded 1 at 86 % of the sampling sites, indicating a high level of chronic ecological risk to aquatic organisms. The assessment of pesticide mixtures posed 15 % to 24 % higher risk levels to aquatic organisms compared to individual pesticides. While the non-carcinogenic risks associated with groundwater across all age groups were below the threshold of 1, there was a significant potential carcinogenic risk, particularly for children, warrants due attention. This study provides a new perspective for the systematic analysis of surface-groundwater systems and identify the exposure potential of pesticides in different water bodies and generate priority levels for risk assessment.
39946885	Capturing temporal variation in aquatic ecotoxicological risks: Chemical- versus effect-based assessment.	The integration of effect-based and chemical profiling has been advocated to assess the potential ecotoxicological risks posed by chemical mixtures present in aquatic ecosystems. However, the concentrations of contaminants in surface waters can vary greatly over time and space, making it challenging to ensure risk assessment. Although the first results are promising, it has not yet been proven that these combined approaches are also capable of capturing temporal variation in aquatic ecotoxicological risks. The present study aimed to test this by combining passive time-integrative sampling with effect-based and chemical-analytical techniques in agricultural waterways. Silicone rubber sheets and polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were deployed in four agricultural water bodies over four consecutive six-week periods. Passive sampler extracts were analysed using a battery of 22 in vitro and in vivo bioassays in tandem with extensive chemical target analysis of 225 compounds. The extracts induced fluctuating bioassay responses over time for all locations during all sampling periods, highlighting the presence of temporal and spatial variation in toxic pressure. A range of compounds, primarily fungicides and herbicides, were detected in the passive sampler extracts during all sampling periods and at all locations at variable concentrations, highlighting the persistent but variable chemical pressure in surface waters in agricultural regions. However, the toxicity observed in the in vitro bioassays could solely be attributed to detected chemicals in 6 % of the cases with those chemicals explaining only 1-16.9 % of the observed effects, indicating that these were predominantly caused by undetected chemicals. Risk assessments based on bioassay responses revealed frequent exceedances of effect-based trigger values at all locations and during all sampling periods. It is concluded that effect-based assessments better capture temporal variations in potential ecotoxicological risks than traditional chemical analyses, but that advanced chemical analysis is needed to explain the bioanalytical response profiles.
39946884	Pesticides and veterinary pharmaceuticals in neotropical avian carnivores: A scoping review.	Organic contaminants have long been known to have negative consequences for wildlife health. For avian carnivores, particular concern surrounds the use of compounds such as pesticides and pharmaceutical drugs, derived from global agricultural and veterinary practices. Previous cases of avian poisoning in North America, Europe and Asia have received great attention, owing to significant declines in avian populations and wider consequences. By contrast, the Neotropics, comprised of Latin America and the Caribbean, has received relatively little attention, despite an extensive agricultural sector and uniquely high avian biodiversity. To evaluate the available evidence on this topic, a scoping review on the effects of agriculturally derived organic contaminants on Neotropical avian carnivores was conducted. Articles from seven databases were screened using exclusion criteria. Of these, 206 primary research articles published since 1965 were identified, investigating 144 compounds in 83 species. Findings indicate substantial knowledge gaps, particularly in observational studies conducted within the Neotropics. Whilst cross-sectional studies were fairly well-represented, with transitions towards less-invasive sampling methods, there were few longitudinal studies, raising concerns of undetected chronic exposure in Neotropical populations. Multiple avian taxonomic families were underrepresented, including globally recognized sentinel species - the osprey and barn owl, as were pharmaceutical drugs in comparison to pesticides. There was a large geographical bias in observational study location, with no research outputs identified from most Neotropical countries. Further research in the Neotropics is required to better understand the pervasiveness of contaminants in native populations, along with improving our understanding of their precise consequences on avian carnivore health.
39946883	Occurrence, distribution, and prioritization of unregulated emerging contaminants including battery-related chemicals in drinking water systems across South Korea.	This study investigated the presence of 95 emerging contaminants comprising pharmaceuticals, stimulants, artificial sweeteners, nicotine metabolites, corrosion inhibitors, battery-related pollutants, and pesticides across 70 drinking water treatment plants. Battery-related contaminants (lithium, nickel, and cobalt), with total concentrations raging from 424 to 38,500 ng/L (median 2560 ng/L) in the raw water and from 596 to 34,300 ng/L (median 2510 ng/L) in the treated water, showed the highest detection frequencies (≥99 %). The median levels of nickel (1440 ng/L in raw water and 1620 ng/L in treated water) were higher than those of lithium (591 ng/L in raw water and 445 ng/L in treated water) and cobalt (233 ng/L in raw water and 95.3 ng/L in treated water). Organic contaminants (raw water: 33.6-6540 ng/L, median 827 ng/L; treated water: not detected-1900 ng/L, median 121 ng/L) mostly had lower total levels than battery-related chemicals. Telmisartan (median 36.6 ng/L in raw water and median 7.47 ng/L in treated water) and valsartan acid (median 26.3 ng/L in raw water and median 6.61 ng/L in treated water) were the predominant pharmaceuticals. For corrosion inhibitors, benzothiazole (29.0 ng/L in raw water and 7.21 ng/L in treated water) displayed the highest median concentrations. Bentazone (median 119 ng/L) was the most predominant pesticide in raw water. The distribution patterns of contaminants in raw water were related to various pollution sources in industries, agricultural zones, and daily life. Additionally, rainfall increased the inflow of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and benzothiazole into public waterways. According to the human health risk assessment using the maximum levels of contaminants, lithium, nickel, cobalt, and valsartan acid were the priority contaminants in treated water, indicating potential risks or need for further evaluation. The priority contaminants with high or moderate risks to aquatic ecosystems in raw water were three battery-related chemicals, six pharmaceuticals, and five pesticides.
39946819	p-AAB/MXene as a novel adsorbent and SALDI matrix for highly efficient enrichment and rapid MS detection of emerging environmental organic pollutants in beverages and PM<sub>2.5</sub>.	Due to the complicated sample matrix and low concentration, analysis of small-molecule emerging environmental pollutants generally required complex sample preparation and long instrumental detection. It guarantees the sensitivity but is not conducive to rapid screening. In this work, a p-aminoazobenzene (p-AAB) with excellent energy absorption capability was used to modify multilayer Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>X</sub> (MXene) to prepare novel material p-AAB/MXene. The modification significantly improved the laser absorption of original material, and made p-AAB/MXene could be employed as matrix for surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (SALDI-TOF MS) analysis of small-molecule emerging pollutants. More importantly, p-AAB/MXene could be used as adsorbent to enrich target compounds, then directly sent to SALDI-TOF MS detection without any other sample pre-treatment. Dual characteristics of enrichment material and matrix made p-AAB/MXene-based SALDI-TOF MS method successfully be applied to rapid and accurate detection of emerging environmental pollutants, p-phenylenediamine-quinones (PPDQs) and diamide insecticides (DAIs), in food (beverage) and environmental (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) samples. High sensitivity (LOD at ng mL<sup>-1</sup> level) and satisfactory precision (RSD < 11%) indicated the qualified analytical performance of developed approach. The determined concentrations also elucidated the broad occurrence of PPDQs and DAIs in beverages and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The results further confirmed the SALDI-TOF MS using p-AAB/MXene as both adsorbent and matrix had considerable potential for efficient and time-saving analysis of trace and ultra-trace small-molecule emerging environmental organic pollutants in complicated samples.
39946394	Integrating transcriptome and metabolomics revealed the key metabolic pathway response of Amaranthus retroflexus L. to the resistance to fomesafen.	Amaranthus retroflexus L. is one of the main broad-leaved weeds in soybean fields in Heilongjiang Province and is an important factor affecting soybean yield. It is becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides. However, studies on the transcriptome level and the molecular mechanism of secondary metabolite accumulation of resistant varieties of Amaranthus retroflexus L. have not been reported. Therefore, comprehensive analysis of transcriptome and metabolome is needed to determine the key metabolic pathways and key genes of Amaranthus retroflexus L.
39946355	From larva to adult: In vitro rearing protocol for honey bee (Apis mellifera) drones.	Development of a successful in vitro rearing protocol has been essential for pesticide safety assessment of immature honey bee workers under laboratory conditions. In contrast, pesticide safety testing of honey bee drones is limited, in part due to the lack of successful laboratory rearing protocols for this reproductive caste. Considering that healthy drones are essential for successful mating and reproduction of the honey bee queen, a standardized in vitro rearing protocol for honey bee drones is necessary to support reproductive safety studies, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of honey bee drone development. Using the established in vitro rearing protocol for honey bee workers, we modified the days of grafting and pupal transfer, as well as the diet volume, pupation plate orientation, and absorbent tissue in the pupal wells to successfully rear honey bee drones in vitro. In vitro-reared drones were evaluated for gross wing abnormalities, body weight, testes weight, and abdominal area, and compared with age-matched drones reared in field colonies. We found that honey bee drones reared in a vertically oriented pupation plate containing WypAll® absorbent tissue in each well had a mean survival to adulthood of 74 ± 3.5% (SEM) until adulthood. In contrast, drones reared in a horizontally oriented pupation plate containing Kimwipe® absorbent tissue in each well had significantly lower survival (5.5 ± 2.3%) and demonstrated gross wing abnormalities. All in vitro-reared drones had significantly lower body weight, testes weight and abdominal area relative to colony-reared control drones. Accordingly, we successfully developed an in vitro rearing protocol for honey bee drones which has the potential to improve future reproductive safety assessment of pesticides for honey bees.
39946325	Occupational health safety in aquaculture: A case study on semi-intensive shrimp farmers of Bangladesh.	The study examined health safety issues among semi-intensive shrimp farmers in southwestern Bangladesh. The study assessed semi-intensive shrimp farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) on health and safety during their farm activities. The KAP model examined working circumstances, exposures, health complaints, diseases, current health status, and job satisfaction. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 158 semi-intensive shrimp farmers from Bangladesh's Khulna, Satkhira, and Bagerhat districts. Type-based data analysis was done. We used Spearman's rank correlation and multiple linear regression. Only 35% of respondents said that they knew the health safety of chemicals and pesticides used in semi-intensive shrimp farms and that safety training is needed, and all farmers wanted to attend when available. At least 74% of farmers used masks when handling pesticides, fertilizers, and chemicals. 40.50% of farmers used protective clothing, 91% cleansed their hands, legs, and face after each day's work, and 94% felt that sanitization reduces pesticide, fertilizer, and chemical pollution. A significant positive correlation coefficient was established in KAP. Education significantly increased knowledge. Practices varied with health and safety training. Results suggest that attitudes determine practices, where knowledge is significantly associated with attitudes. A comprehensive health safety and hygiene training program for all shrimp farmers should be developed to raise awareness, reduce illness outbreaks, and preserve healthy living.
39946298	Neuroprotective Effect of <i>Withaferin</i> Derivatives toward MPP<sup>+</sup> and 6-OHDA Toxicity to Dopaminergic Neurons.	Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative proteinopathy that primarily affects mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. This dopaminergic depletion can be phenotypically reproduced in various experimental models through the administration of two neurotoxins: N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The mechanisms underlying the cell death processes induced by these toxins remain a subject of debate. In this context, studies suggest that oxidative-stress-related processes may contribute to the dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, investigating pharmacological compounds that can counteract these processes remains crucial for developing therapeutic strategies targeting these neuropathological mechanisms. <i>Withania somnifera</i> (L.) <i>Dunal</i>, commonly known as <i>ashwagandha</i>, is a plant whose roots are used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat various ailments, including those affecting the central nervous system. The active compound <i>Withaferin-A</i> (<i>WFA</i>), a steroid lactone from the <i>withanolide</i> group, is reported to possess antioxidant properties. In this study, we explored the potential neuroprotective effects of <i>WFA</i> and two of its molecular derivatives, <i>cr-591</i> and <i>cr-777</i>, which contain, respectively, an additional cysteine or glutathione chemical group, known for their antiradical properties. We demonstrated that <i>WFA</i> and its two derivatives, <i>cr-591</i> and <i>cr-777</i>, protect the integrity and function of dopaminergic neurons exposed to the neurotoxins MPP<sup>+</sup> and 6-OHDA both in vitro, using primary mesencephalic neuron cultures from rodents, and in vivo, using the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.
39946273	Identification, Characterization, and Fungicide Sensitivity of Botryosphaeriaceae Fungi Associated with Avocado Branch Canker Disease in Southern California.	Avocado branch canker disease, caused by Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, threatens avocado (<i>Persea americana</i> Mill.) production in California, reducing yield and orchard lifespan. To effectively manage avocado branch canker, it is imperative to identify the causal fungal species accurately and understand their biology and pathogenic potential. Over 500 fungal isolates were collected from symptomatic branches of avocados showing a general decline, including cankers and dieback of arms and twigs across several California orchards (n=23). Seventy-one representative isolates were selected for detailed analysis based on location, tissue type, colony morphology, and spore characteristics. Multi-locus phylogenetic analysis identified four Botryosphaeriaceae species: <i>Neofusicoccum luteum</i> (most prevalent, 66 isolates), <i>Lasiodiplodia theobromae</i> (3 isolates), <i>Botryosphaeria dothidea</i> (1 isolate), and <i>Neofusicoccum australe</i> (1 isolate). Pathogenicity tests revealed significant variability in aggressiveness, with <i>L. theobromae</i> (26.3 ± 3.77 mm) and <i>N. luteum</i> (23.6 ± 0.87 mm) causing the largest lesions. Additionally, a sporulation trial on an <i>N. australe</i> isolate revealed that acidified potato dextrose agar amended with sterilized pine needles at 22°C under constant light optimized its sporulation. In vitro fungicide assays identified fluazinam as the most effective fungicide across the species exhibiting the lowest EC<sub>50</sub> values. Metconazole and propiconazole also exhibited low EC<sub>50</sub>, while azoxystrobin and boscalid showed the highest. Furthermore, <i>L. theobromae</i> showed reduced sensitivity to azoxystrobin (18.711 μg/mL), cyproconazole (6.381 μg/mL), flutriafol (4.151 μg/mL), and pyraclostrobin (5.477 μg/mL). These findings highlight the importance of species-specific identification and provide critical insights for integrated disease management strategies.
39946205	Availability of pesticide-treated seeds and bird occurrence in freshly drilled onion and carrot fields in Brazil.	Agricultural landscapes in Brazil provide habitat to various bird species, which may be exposed to pesticide-treated seeds that have not been incorporated into the soil during drilling. Understanding the dynamics and interactions between birds and drilled fields is crucial for developing sustainable farming practices that balance agricultural food production with wildlife conservation. This study focused on the attractivity of freshly drilled onion and carrot fields to birds and the potential exposure of birds to the pesticide-treated onion and carrot seeds available on the soil surface after drilling in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Bird surveys were conducted using scan sampling and point count methods to assess diversity and behavior before, on the day of drilling, and after drilling. Carrot fields showed a decrease in observed species and individuals on the day of drilling, with an increase in bird sightings after drilling. Similar trends were observed in onion fields, with the species composition changing after drilling and a significant decrease in abundance on the day of drilling. None of the species found foraging in the field after drilling were granivorous or omnivorous. Seed exposure was assessed by counting available seeds on the soil surface at different time points after drilling. Seed exposure was higher in the field border than in the field center. These findings indicate that carrot and onion fields offer limited food sources for granivore bird species probably due to low seed availability and intensive seedbed preparation. The research also suggests that freshly drilled carrot and onion crops are unattractive to foraging birds, with low seed exposure and a reduced likelihood of contact with pesticides applied as a seed treatment.
39946167	Characterization of two cellular superoxide dismutases in Protohermes xanthodes (Megaloptera: Corydalidae) in response to sublethal chlorpyrifos stress.	Pesticides released into the environment are increasingly recognized as a global threat to freshwater ecosystems because of their adverse effects on non-target organisms, particularly aquatic insects and other arthropods. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are important antioxidant enzymes that play a crucial role in protecting organisms from oxidative stress induced by harmful materials. In this study, we identified 2 cellular SODs (PxSOD1 and PxSOD2) in Protohermes xanthodes Navás (Megaloptera: Corydalidae), an freshwater predatory insect, and determined the oxidative stress induced in P. xanthodes larvae by sublethal exposure to chlorpyrifos (CPF). PxSOD1 and PxSOD2 are members of the cytoplasmic Cu/ZnSODs and mitochondrial MnSODs, respectively, and differ substantially in protein structure. Both PxSOD1 and PxSOD2 recombinant proteins demonstrated catalytic activity toward O2•- in the activity assays. After exposure to sublethal concentrations of CPF, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and SOD activities were increased in P. xanthodes larvae in a dose-dependent manner. PxSOD1 expression was decreased in the 0.42 and 4.2 μg/L CPF groups and increased in the 4.2 μg/L CPF group. PxSOD2 was upregulated by 0.42, 4.2, and 8.4 μg/L CPF treatments and the expression levels in the 4.2 and 8.4 μg/L CPF groups were significantly higher than that in the no CPF control. Our results suggest that sublethal concentrations of CPF can induce oxidative stress in P. xanthodes larvae, and the cellular SODs in P. xanthodes larvae may contribute to the protection against CPF-induced oxidative stress.
39946059	Boosting Biotic Stress Resistance in Solanum melongena L.: The Role of Exogenous Chlorogenic Acid in Enhancing Secondary Metabolite Production.	Solanum melongena Linnaeus (brinjal) belongs to the Solanaceae family and is also known as eggplant. It is one of the most common vegetables that is grown abundantly and consumed by a large number of people. However, it is found to be highly susceptible to harmful pests such as brinjal shoot and fruit borer, (Leucinodes orbonalis) which are responsible for causing severe damage to the plant's health and, correspondingly, its yield. Damages include shoot and leaf spoilage which leads to overall hampering of the metabolic process of the plant. This study aims to suggest that the plant, Solanum melongena L., has certain self-induced mechanisms to withstand these stress and pest attacks by secreting compounds known as "Chlorogenic Acid." Chlorogenic acid is known to be a plant-derived product and is a part of secondary metabolites. Different plant parts were examined for their diverse secondary metabolite content under laboratory conditions. The study was further proceeded by implementing chlorogenic acid exogenously, on the pest-infected plants at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in two different foliar sprays, one consisting of simple water and another 50% ethanol. Moreover, molecular analysis shows a higher expression of the genes which are pivotal for the secretion of chlorogenic acid within the plant itself. The results of this research reveal that chlorogenic acid exhibits a massive potential in controlling pest attacks against Solanum melongena L. and can be used as a potential bio-pesticide.
39945990	Development of Multifunctional C-dots from Processing Waste of Pomelo Fruits for Determination of pH and Methyl Parathion.	Multifunctional fluorescent C-dots from Pomelo wastes (peel/pomace) were produced using microwave and hydrothermal treatment. Surface of synthesized C-dots were modified to detect the pesticide in food samples. Synthesized C-dots and functionalized C-dots were characterized using FTIR; SEM; and UV spectroscopy. Microwave synthesized C-dots were of amorphous structure and particle size were in the range of 0.4 to 2.5 nm. The surface passivated C-dots were used as a nanoprobe for cost-effective detection of methyl parathion in food samples; however C-dots without surface passivation were utilized sucessfully for the development of pH paper for determination of pH (3.5-12.5). Fluorescent intensity of developed pH paper varied linearly with the change in the pH. Utilizing optical characteristics and a large number of surface functional groups, C-dots have a potential to be used as a fluorescence or fluorescent sensor to detect methyl parathion from food samples by following the "turn-on-off" mechanism. LOD and LOQ level of surface passivated C-dots were 0.12 and 0.46 mg/L respectively for parathion methyl pesticide.
39945918	Dynamics of pesticide residues in soils during the growing season: a case study in peach orchards, east-central Portugal.	Permanent crops rely heavily on pesticides. Their short-term behaviour has already been characterised under laboratory conditions. However, their degradation in the field is still poorly understood. Furthermore, studies that relate pesticide residues in soil with their application history are still scarce, despite their relevance for inferring the historical and diffuse dimensions of pollution. This work explores the spatial and temporal dynamics of pesticide residues in soil under the light of their application records and the accuracy of the predicted environmental concentrations (PEC). To achieve these purposes, 270 soil samples were collected at 5 sampling times over the 2022 growing season, in 18 peach orchards from east-central Portugal. Moreover, the data extracted from the application records was used to obtain predicted levels which were compared with the measured results. A total of 37 residues were analysed. Overall, 32 of these were detected back in, at least, one sample. Glyphosate and AMPA were the most frequently found and had the highest median concentrations. The comparison between predicted and measured environmental concentrations (MEC) suggests that pesticide decay was generally slower than expected. Glyphosate, AMPA, fluopyram and tebuconazole showed a high potential for resulting in background concentrations in soil. Our results highlight the need for regular and comprehensive monitoring, being recommended long-term assessments of the persistence and fate of pesticides under realistic conditions. Furthermore, our results also stress the necessity of more studies on reasons for PEC-MEC mismatch, a factor of concern considering the regulatory relevance of PEC values.
39945552	Evaluation of Novel Pyridine-Based Compounds Integrating Bioactive Amide and Hydrazide Groups as a Potential Fungicide Agent.	A series of novel pyridine-based compounds integrating bioactive amide and hydrazide groups were designed and synthesized through an active group splicing strategy. The fungicidal bioassays indicated that several compounds showed remarkable and broad-spectrum inhibitory activity. Notably, compound <b>A5</b> displayed satisfactory <i>in vitro</i> fungicidal activity against <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>, <i>Alternaria</i> sp., and <i>Physalospora piricola</i>, with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.53, 2.84, 1.64, 7.59, 4.67, 5.50, and 2.84 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Additionally, <b>A5</b> also showed promising <i>in vivo</i> preventive efficiency against <i>F. graminearum</i> and <i>R. solani</i> at 100 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>. Preliminary investigation of the fungicidal mechanism demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes and differential metabolites in <i>R. solani</i> treated with <b>A5</b> at 10 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> exhibited notable enrichment in pathways associated with lipid metabolism, potentially linking to the plasma membrane contraction observed by TEM. Furthermore, to assess the environmental compatibility of compound <b>A5</b>, its toxicity to zebrafish, hydrolysis rates in different pH buffers, and effects on the growth of wheat seedlings were evaluated. These findings will provide substantial theoretical guidance for the development of new environmentally friendly fungicides.
39945359	Timing Matters: Viticultural Land Use Determines Responses in Structure and Function of Fungal Stream Communities Across One Growing Season.	Fungal communities are critical for leaf decomposition, a central ecosystem function in streams. A wide range of anthropogenic stressors can alter their structure and function (i.e., leaf decomposition). Additionally, fungal communities are subject to seasonal turnover due to natural processes. Despite this, seasonality in interaction with varying stressor exposure has rarely been studied in the context of leaf decomposition. We investigated fungal community composition and leaf decomposition over one agricultural growing season by deploying leaf bags at least impacted forest and viticultural sites of 10 streams. Additionally, we transplanted leaf bags that had been colonised at the forest sites to viticultural sites to investigate how changes in stressor exposure affect the structure and function of fungal communities. Leaf decomposition was repeatedly lower in the viticultural treatment than in the forest treatment, which was partly explained by the environmental variables. The decomposition of the transplanted leaves varied across the time points and was overall more similar to that of the forest treatment. The fungal communities in April were similar across treatments, whereas all exhibited different seasonal community turnover. At later time points (June, August and September), the fungal communities from the forest and transplant treatment remained similar, likely triggered by the priority effects of the location of colonisation (forest). The viticultural treatment, however, deviated at these time points, which coincided with the timing of fungicide application. Overall, we show that both community composition and function of leaf decomposition exhibit seasonal and stressor-related variability. Thus, our study demonstrates that seasonality and the actual stressor regime need to be considered and well described when investigating land use effects on leaf decomposition and associated fungal communities.
39945306	A novel detoxification strategy of Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) to dimethoate based on gut microbiota research.	Bombyx mori (L.) (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) is an important economic insect, and Exorista sorbillans (W.) (Diptera: Tachinidae) is an endoparasitic pest of larval B. mori. Dimethoate is less toxic to B. mori than E. sorbillans and is used in sericulture to controlling E. sorbillans. To investigate the effects of dimethoate treatment on the gut microorganisms and physiological functions of B. mori, 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyzed the composition and structure of the gut microbiota. This study investigated their role in enhancing silkworm resistance by screening dominant populations after dimethoate treatment. The results indicated that dimethoate did not alter the composition of the dominant gut bacterial groups in silkworm; however, it significantly increased the abundance of the gut bacteria Methylobacterium and Aureimonas, and decreased the abundance of Enterobacterales, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Collinsella, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella. Eleven strains of dimethoate-resistant bacteria were selected through in vitro culture, all of which were unable to grow when dimethoate was used as a carbon source. Additionally, a germ-free silkworm model was established to assess detoxifying enzyme activity in the midgut. The results revealed that the gut symbiotic microbiota can enhance dimethoate resistance by increasing detoxification enzyme activity. This study identifies a novel pathway for silkworm resistance to dimethoate based on gut microbiota, providing new insights into the role of symbiotic gut bacteria in insecticide metabolism.
39945300	The rational design of a Rhodamine fluorescent probe enables the selective detection and bioimaging of salicylic acid in plants under abiotic stress.	Abiotic stress severely hinders plant growth and development, resulting in a considerable reduction in crop yields. Salicylic acid (SA) serves as a central signal mediating abiotic stress responses in plants. Real-time fluorescence tracking using specific probes can enhance our understanding of the SA-triggered modulation underlying these events. However, in complicated living plant microenvironments, selective recognition and bioimaging of SA is a great challenge for scientists due to the severe background interference and SA analogues. Herein, an efficient fluorescence probing technology employing a highly selective rhodamine probe-phoxrodam was developed, which realizes the precise bioimaging of SA in salt-stressed plant seedlings. Experimental findings reveal that phoxrodam demonstrates exceptional selectivity (fluorescence intensity: I<sub>Phoxrodam+SA</sub>/I<sub>Phoxrodam+SA analogues</sub> > 4.29-fold), high sensitivity (limit of detection = 6.42 nM, fluorescence quantum yield: Φ<sub>Phoxrodam+SA</sub> = 0.36) and good anti-interference properties. Furthermore, we confirmed that phoxrodam accurately detects SA in the roots of salt-stressed wheat seedlings, the low-temperature resistance of Nicotiana benthamiana and the heavy metal resistance of pea seeds, using in vivo confocal imaging. This study provides a feasible strategy for efficiently tracking plant signalling molecules and promotes the in-depth research of SA-mediated physiological mechanisms, laying a key foundation for the future development of new immune activation inducers.
39945257	Parkinson's Disease: From Bench to Bedside-Advancements in Diagnosis and Therapeutics using Pharmacogenomic Approach.	This article provides a detailed look at Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative ailment mostly known for movement difficulties such tremor, stiffness, and bradykinesia, which affects approximately 1% of persons over the age of 60. Although the precise cause of PD is still unknown, various factors such as pesticide exposure, genetics, and lifestyle choices like smoking and caffeine consumption are thought to play a role in its development. The presence of Lewy bodies characterizes the disease, the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and disruptions in basal ganglia circuitry, resulting in both motor and nonmotor symptoms. This review is structured into several key sections, beginning with an exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms behind PD, including how genetic mutations can lead to deficits in the Ubiquitin Proteasome System and mitochondrial function, which are linked to familial cases of the disease. Following this, the article explores diagnostic methods, such as the UK Brain Bank Criteria, advanced imaging techniques, olfactory testing, and innovative technologies like machine learning, all of which support early detection and accurate diagnosis of PD. Treatment strategies are also comprehensively reviewed, focusing on traditional pharmacological options like levodopa and dopamine agonists, as well as surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation. Additionally, the review discusses promising new therapies, including immunotherapy aimed at neuroinflammation and gene therapy for disease modification. The impact of lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet on reducing PD risk and enhancing symptom management are also considered. In conclusion, this review highlights the complex nature of Parkinson's disease and underscores the need for a holistic approach that combines pharmacotherapy, advanced treatments, and lifestyle adjustments. By addressing both symptom management and disease modification, these strategies provide hope for improving quality of life.
39945093	Nomograms applicability in clinical toxicology - enhancing precision in clinical decision-making: a systematic review.	Nomograms represent powerful predictive tools that could be easily applied to guide managing acutely intoxicated patients. Thus, several nomograms were developed and validated in the last few decades to predict various outcomes following acute poisoning. However, the adopted nomograms remain sporadic efforts of researchers that limited their usefulness in clinical settings. We aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical formulation and hands-on application of the developed nomograms to benefit acutely poisoned patients. In this context, this systematic review was conducted to be a reference guide for implementing these nomograms in clinical toxicology practice. This review included 27 studies that were published over 60 years. A total of 60,883 patients ranging between 2 and 91 years were enrolled. These studies elaborated 38 nomograms; 13 nomograms addressed acute poisoning in general, and 25 nomograms were specially designed for six poisons/categories, including pesticides (<i>n</i> = 9), psychotropic drugs (<i>n</i> = 5), alcohol (<i>n</i> = 4), analgesics, and anti-inflammatory medications (<i>n</i> = 3), carbon monoxide (<i>n</i> = 2), and digoxin (<i>n</i> = 2). Despite the first nomogram was published in 1960, 81.5% of nomograms emerged after 2016, with a significant increase in the trend of published nomograms (<i>p</i> < .001). The Glasgow Coma Scale, patient age, poison concentration, bicarbonate level, and blood pressure were the most frequently used predictors. The nomograms were designed to predict eight outcomes, including mortality (<i>n</i> = 14, 36.8%), need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission (<i>n</i> = 9, 23.7%), complications of poisoning (<i>n</i> = 6, 15.8%), optimization of therapy (<i>n</i> = 4, 10.5%), and poisoning severity (<i>n</i> = 2, 5.3%). Also, the need for mechanical ventilation (MV), diagnosis of poisoning, and suicidal poisoning were predicted by one nomogram for each of them. The developed nomograms' performances were tested using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the area under a curve of 26 derived nomograms ranged between 0.839 and 0.999. External validation was conducted on 16 nomograms only; 15 nomograms were validated using validation cohorts within the same studies that developed the nomograms. However, only one nomogram was subjected to external validation by other studies. The externally validated nomograms consist of 10 nomograms for managing particular poisoning and, six nomograms for un-specified poisoning. The poison-specific nomograms were concerned with acute poisoning with pesticides (<i>n</i> = 4), methanol (<i>n</i> = 2), opioid (<i>n</i> = 1), clozapine (<i>n</i> = 1), carbon monoxide (<i>n</i> = 1), and digoxin (<i>n</i> = 1). Regarding six validated nomograms in a general poisoning approach, two nomograms predicted mortality. Nevertheless, four separate nomograms were concerned with the prediction of poisoning complications, the need for ICU admission, the need for MV, and suicidal poisoning. The external validation of the established nomograms ensured their performance and reliability for universal applicability in clinical settings. Meanwhile, the remaining 22 nomograms lacking external validation represent promising research opportunities.

Sustainability and environmental impact assessments of trade and investment agreements need to address biodiversity more effectively. To showcase this, we examined a report, commissioned by Switzerland, on potential environmental impacts and risks of the trade between Switzerland and the Mercosur under the EFTA-Mercosur Free Trade Agreement. Our analysis focuses on chemical pollution, regulatory impact, duty-free precious minerals, deforestation, and greenhouse gas emission to develop a roadmap for (re-)interpreting (muted) risks on biodiversity in light of the Global Biodiversity Framework. Our analytical approach on normative and substantive effectiveness of impact assessments encourages broader responses to impacts of economic policies on biodiversity and ecosystems.
39944898	Exploring the Joint Association Between Agrichemical Mixtures and Pediatric Cancer.	Nebraska's age-adjusted incidence rates for childhood cancers are among the highest in the US. Previous studies indicated associations between agrichemical exposures (atrazine and nitrates) and pediatric cancer rate, assuming single pollutant exposure. We evaluated the joint association between the agricultural mixture and pediatric cancer. Agrichemical exposures at a county scale were quantified using the USGS Pesticide National Synthesis Project for frequently applied pesticides from 1992 to 2014 in 93 Nebraska counties. Outcomes were quantified using pediatric cancer diagnosed among children <20 years of age (1992-2014) from the Nebraska cancer registry. We adjusted for social vulnerability factors such as race, income, employment, and access to care. The associations between 32 agrichemicals and cancer subtypes were assessed using the Generalized Weighted Quantile Sum Regression (gWQS) model. The model was fit assuming a Poisson distribution and using the pediatric population as an offset-term and social vulnerability factors as covariates. We observed a statistically significant positive association between the 32 agrichemicals and overall pediatric cancer and subtypes. The strength of associations was slightly stronger among brain and CNS cancers (<i>β</i> = 0.36, CI = 0.14, 0.57) compared to overall cancer (<i>β</i> = 0.30, CI = 0.16, 0.44) and leukemia (<i>β</i> = 0.23, CI = 0.09, 0.38). Dicamba, glyphosate, paraquat, quizalofop, triasulfuron, and tefluthrin largely contributed to the joint association. These findings may explain the joint associations of the agrichemical mixture on childhood cancer. Alternative biomarker-based approaches to measuring human exposure are worth investigating for chemicals of concern, particularly in counties with high agrichemical and cancer rates.

Most of the compounds exhibited excellent activity against three plant pathogenic bacteria. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub>) of compound <b>B7</b> for <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>) and <i>X. oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzicola</i> (<i>Xoc</i>) concentrations were 0.4 and 1.0 mg/L, respectively. In addition, the EC<sub>50</sub> values of compounds <b>B1</b> and <b>B24</b> for <i>Xoo</i>, <i>Xoc</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>actinidiae</i> (<i>Psa</i>) were less than 5 mg/L and significantly better than those of the positive control agents thiodiazole copper (121.8, 119.5, and 142.0 mg/L, respectively) and bismerthiazol (73.3, 65.6, and 128.8 mg/L, respectively). Compound <b>B7</b> exhibited protective and curative activities of 48.1 and 46.7%, respectively, against bacterial leaf blight, which were higher than those of bismerthiazol (35.5 and 36.9%, respectively) and thiodiazole copper (39.3 and 39.5%, respectively). Additionally, compound <b>B7</b> exerted an effect on the virulence factors of <i>Xoo</i> (production of exopolysaccharides and extracellular enzymes, biofilm formation, and motility), membrane permeability, cell surface morphology, and intracellular content of reactive oxygen species. Transcriptome analysis showed that compound <b>B7</b> improved the resistance of rice plants to external stress by influencing the metabolic process, biological regulation, catalytic activity of enzymes, and plant-pathogen interaction. Compound <b>B7</b> can therefore be considered as a potential candidate antibacterial agent and warrants an in-depth investigation in the future.
39943787	Challenges and opportunities for embedding social science in pesticide resistance research and outreach.	Pesticide resistance constitutes a growing management challenge across agricultural systems worldwide, as complex interplays between social, biophysical, and technological factors create wicked problems that resist simple solutions. Transdisciplinary approaches that bring together researchers and practitioners with diverse disciplinary repertoires have been proposed to tackle pesticide resistance but, despite increasing interest, remain sporadic and often ineffective. In many cases this is due to an insufficient involvement of social scientists, misconceptions that better management merely requires more information, and limited appreciation for the diversity of social scientific perspectives. This article addresses this dearth by synthesizing relevant scholarship to show how the social sciences can help to better understand and more effectively manage pesticide resistance. Following an overview of the main theoretical and methodological approaches employed by social scientists, we demonstrate their nuanced practical contributions in herbicide and insecticide resistance management. These cases demonstrate that the crux of pesticide resistance management is context, with no one-size-fits-all solutions. Social scientists can offer a diverse range of distinct perspectives and tools to jointly develop context-specific solutions with biophysical and applied scientists. However, effective transdisciplinarity requires early collaborative problem framing involving all disciplinary partners and meaningful ongoing engagements. The article, therefore, concludes with practical suggestions for how pest management researchers and practitioners can start to connect with social scientists to more holistically address the various aspects that make pesticide resistance management a complex wicked problem. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.
39943717	Inhibition of EPSPS overexpression of glyphosate-resistant Lolium perenne L. with a clethodim and glyphosate mixture.	Glyphosate-resistant populations of some grass species have demonstrated high sensitivity to combinations of glyphosate and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibiting herbicides. Nevertheless, it is unclear how glyphosate contributes to the control of glyphosate-resistant plants when combined with other active ingredients such as clethodim. The current work aimed to detect if glyphosate-resistant Lolium perenne L. biotypes associated with target-site [5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS)] overexpression and EPSPS mutation (P106S) as mechanisms of resistance are equally controlled by clethodim or clethodim plus glyphosate compared to a susceptible counterpart.
39943702	Comparative transcriptomics reveals different profiles between diflubenzuron-resistant and -susceptible phenotypes of the mosquito Culex pipiens.	Chitin-synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) represent a major tool in vector control. The intensive use of these compounds has led to the evolution of resistance against several CSIs, including diflubenzuron (DFB). DFB resistance has been associated to a target-site mechanism; however, studies investigating the gene expression profile of resistant phenotypes are limited, preventing a full understanding of DFB resistance. Here, we analyzed the constitutive gene expression of susceptible and DFB-resistant individuals of the mosquito Culex pipiens, a major disease vector in temperate areas.
